"JSF 2.2 - @Inject @ThirteenNumber throw NullPointException

I try to work with `@Injection`, so start with a simple example here :

**Interface** 

    public interface NumberGenerator {
        String generateNumber();
    }

**BookService**

    public class BookServices {
    
        @Inject
        @ThirteenNumber
        private NumberGenerator generator;
        
        public Book createBook(String title){
            return new Book(title, generator.generateNumber());
        }
    }

**Book Object** 

    public class Book {
        
        private String title;
        private String isbn;
    
        public Book() {
        }
        
        public Book(String title, String isbn) {
            this.title = title;
            this.isbn = isbn;
        }
        
        //getters and setters
    }

**CDI**

    @Named(value = ""injectionTest"") 
    @ViewScoped 
    public class InjectionTest implements Serializable {
    
        public void showResult() {
            BookServices bookService = new BookServices();
            Book book = bookService.createBook(""Java book"");
            System.out.println(book.toString());
        }
        
        //...
    }

**ThirteenNumber Implementation**

    @ThirteenNumber
    public class IsbnGenerator implements NumberGenerator{
        
        @Override
        public String generateNumber(){
            return ""13-84333-"" + Math.abs(new Random().nextInt());
        }
    }

**Problem**

When i try to call `bookService.createBook(""Java book"")` it throw a `java.lang.NullPointerException`, in `generator.generateNumber()` i think it not call the right `@Qualifier`, a tried to solve this problem, using this link, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21363931/java-ee-7-cdi-injection-doesnt-work-sending-nullpointerexception i add all the dependencies but the problem still the same?

Did i miss something?

**Note** i know about http://stackoverflow.com/questions/218384/what-is-a-nullpointerexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it

"What does google cloud ml-engine do when a Json request contains ""_bytes"" or ""b64""?

<p>The google cloud documentation <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/prediction-overview#prediction_input_data"" rel=""noreferrer"">(see Binary data in prediction input)</a> states: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your encoded string must be formatted as a JSON object with a single
  key named b64. The following Python example encodes a buffer of raw
  JPEG data using the base64 library to make an instance:</p>

<pre><code>{""image_bytes"":{""b64"": base64.b64encode(jpeg_data)}}
</code></pre>
  
  <p>In your TensorFlow model code, you must name the aliases for your
  input and output tensors so that they end with '_bytes'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to understand more about how this process works on the google cloud side. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is the ml-engine automatically decoding any content after the ""b64""
string to byte data? </p></li>
<li><p>When the request has this nested structure, does it only pass in the
""b64"" section to the serving input function and remove the
""image_bytes"" key?  </p></li>
<li><p>Is each request passed individually to the serving input function or
are they batched?</p></li>
<li><p>Do we define the input output aliases in the ServingInputReceiver returned by the serving input function?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have found no way to create a serving input function which uses this nested structure to define the feature placeholders. I only use ""b64"" in mine and I am not sure what the gcloud ml-engine does on receiving the requests.</p>

<p>Additionally when predicting locally using <code>gcloud ml-engine local predict</code>, sending the request with the nested structure fails, (unexpected key image_bytes as it is not defined in the serving input function). But when predicting using <code>gcloud ml-engine predict</code>, sending requests with the nested structure works even when the serving input function contains no reference to ""image_bytes"". The gcloud predict also works when leaving out ""image_bytes"" and passing in just ""b64"".</p>

<p>An example serving input function </p>

<pre><code>def serving_input_fn():
    feature_placeholders = {'b64': tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.string,
                                                  shape=[None],
                                                  name='source')}
    single_image = tf.decode_raw(feature_placeholders['b64'], tf.float32)
    inputs = {'image': single_image}
    return tf.estimator.export.ServingInputReceiver(inputs, feature_placeholders)
</code></pre>

<p>I gave the example using images but I assume the same should apply to all types of data sent as bytes and base64 encoded.</p>

<p>There are a lot of stackoverflow questions which contain references to the need to include ""_bytes"" with snippets of information, but I would find it useful if someone could explain a bit more in detail whats going on as then I wouldn't be so hit and miss when formatting requests.</p>

"Java call performance vs search performance

<p>Currently my program is filled with many ugly references that often make field or method access look like this: <code>weakReference1.get().weakReference2.get().field1.getSomeCustomObject().field2</code>. I want to move to shorter and faster strong references like <code>field1.field2</code>.

"How to specify a Moment.js object annotation in Flow

<p>I'm currently learning Flow by applying it to an existing project and looking to annotate function parameters as a Moment.JS objects. </p>

<p>Using <a href=""https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/"" rel=""noreferrer"">flow-typed</a> I was able to install a library definition for Moment.JS which appears to have the type I'm looking for:</p>

<pre><code>declare class moment$Moment {
  static ISO_8601: string;
  static (string?: string, format?: string|Array&lt;string&gt;, locale?: string, strict?: bool): moment$Moment;
  static (initDate: ?Object|number|Date|Array&lt;number&gt;|moment$Moment|string): moment$Moment;
  static unix(seconds: number): moment$Moment;
  static utc(): moment$Moment;
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>However when I try to annotate function parameters as Moment.JS objects, Flow fails to recognize them as such. In the following function <code>startDate</code> and <code>endDate</code> are Moment.JS date objects.</p>

<pre><code>const filterByDateWhereClause = (startDate: Moment, endDate: Moment): string =&gt; {...};
</code></pre>

<p>Flow gives the following error:</p>

<pre><code>const filterByDateWhereClause = (startDate: Moment, endDate: Moment): string =&gt;
                                                 ^^^^^^ identifier `Moment`. Could not resolve name
</code></pre>

<p>Is this even possible with Flow? Or do I need to duplicate the <code>type</code> for the Moment.JS object identical to the one in the library definition provided by flow-type? I'd prefer not to do this as the libdef is fairly lengthy. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>declare class Moment {
  static ISO_8601: string;
  static (string?: string, format?: string|Array&lt;string&gt;, locale?: string, strict?: bool): moment$Moment;
  static (initDate: ?Object|number|Date|Array&lt;number&gt;|moment$Moment|string): moment$Moment;

"Android keyboard language matching person

Since I am living abroad I often find myself writing to people in different languages. Every time I have to switch to the correct language to avoid false autocorrection.

"inline expansion compiles into a function call [c++]

<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>I have been creating a simple wrapper classes. I randomly found out that <em>(or it appears to be)</em> an inline function still compiled into a function call. I created an example class to test things out and this is what I found:</p>

<p><strong>Consider the following class:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>//compile with MSVC
class InlineTestClass
{
public:
    int InternalInt;

    int         GetInt()        {return InternalInt;}
    inline int  GetInt_Inl()    {return InternalInt;}                
    //__forceinline -Forces the compiler to implement the function as inline
    __forceinline int  GetInt_ForceInl()  {return InternalInt;} 
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This class has 3 functions for reference.</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>GetInt</strong> function is a standard function. </li>
<li>The <strong>GetInt_Inl</strong> function is an inline function.</li>
<li>The <strong>GetInt_ForceInl</strong> function is an ensured inline function in case of the 
compiler deciding not to implement <strong>GetInt_Inl</strong> as inline function</li>
</ul>

<p>Implemented like so:</p>

<pre><code>InlineTestClass itc;
itc.InternalInt = 3;
int myInt;

myInt = itc.InternalInt;       //No function
myInt = itc.GetInt();          //Normal function
myInt = itc.GetInt_Inl();      //Inline function
myInt = itc.GetInt_ForceInl(); //Forced inline function
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting assembler code of the setting of myInt (taken from dissassembler):</p>

<pre><code>       451        myInt = itc.InternalInt;
0x7ff6fe0d4cae  &lt;+0x003e&gt;         mov     eax,dword ptr [rsp+20h]
0x7ff6fe0d4cb2  &lt;+0x0042&gt;         mov     dword ptr [rsp+38h],eax
        452        myInt = itc.GetInt();
0x7ff6fe0d4cb6  &lt;+0x0046&gt;         lea     rcx,[rsp+20h]
0x7ff6fe0d4cbb  &lt;+0x004b&gt;         call    nD_Render!ILT+2125(?GetIntInlineTestClassQEAAHXZ) (00007ff6`fe0d1852)
0x7ff6fe0d4cc0  &lt;+0x0050&gt;         mov     dword ptr [rsp+38h],eax
        453        myInt = itc.GetInt_Inl();
0x7ff6fe0d4cc4  &lt;+0x0054&gt;         lea     rcx,[rsp+20h]
0x7ff6fe0d4cc9  &lt;+0x0059&gt;         call    nD_Render!ILT+1885(?GetInt_InlInlineTestClassQEAAHXZ) (00007ff6`fe0d1762)
0x7ff6fe0d4cce  &lt;+0x005e&gt;         mov     dword ptr [rsp+38h],eax
        454        myInt = itc.GetInt_ForceInl();
0x7ff6fe0d4cd2  &lt;+0x0062&gt;         lea     rcx,[rsp+20h]
0x7ff6fe0d4cd7  &lt;+0x0067&gt;         call    nD_Render!ILT+715(?GetInt_ForceInlInlineTestClassQEAAHXZ) (00007ff6`fe0d12d0)
0x7ff6fe0d4cdc  &lt;+0x006c&gt;         mov     dword ptr [rsp+38h],eax
</code></pre>

<p>As shown above the setting (of myInt) from the <strong>member</strong> of InlineTestClass directly is <em>(as expected)</em> 2 mov instructions long. 
Setting from the <strong>GetInt</strong> function results in a function call <em>(as expected)</em>, however both of the  <strong>GetInt_Inl</strong> and <strong>GetInt_ForceInl</strong> (inline functions) also result in a function call. </p>

<p>It appears as if the inline function has been compiled as a normal function ignoring the inlining completely <em>(correct me if I am wrong)</em>.</p>

<p>This is strange cause according to <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bw1hbe6y.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSVC documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The inline and __inline specifiers instruct the compiler to insert a
  copy of the function body into each place the function is called.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which <em>(I think)</em> would result in:</p>

<pre><code>inline int  GetInt_Inl() {return InternalInt; //Is the function body}
myInt = itc.GetInt_Inl(); //Call site 

//Should result in
myInt = itc.InternalInt; //Identical to setting from the member directly
</code></pre>

<p>Which means that the assembler code should be also identical to the one of setting from the class member directly but it isn't.</p>

<h2>Questions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Am I missing something or implementing the functions incorrectly?</li>
<li>Am I interpreting the function of the inline keyword? What is it?</li>
<li>Why do these inline functions result in a function call?</li>
</ol>

"Firebase FCM InternalServerError

<p>I implemented Firebase FCM in my app about a month ago, and it has worked great ever since, until today. When I am trying to send a push notification from my console, nothing ever shows up. I find this very strange considering it worked before I went to bed yesterday. I do also have a PHP script that sends push notifications (FCM) as well, which also was working - but when I try to use this to send a push notification, I get this: </p>

<p><code>{""multicast_id"":5593178441415796544,""success"":0,""failure"":1,""canonical_ids"":0,""results"":[{""error"":""InternalServerError""}]}</code></p>

<p>I find this very strange. I Googled this, and I read something about re-generating my APNS certificates (because they might be wrong or something), which I thought was weird as well, due to the fact that I created new certificates yesterday as well (which was working). Now I have once again tried to delete, and generate new - without any luck. </p>

<p>I also want to point out that when I go to my 'Cloud messaging' tab in Firebase, to configure my certificates, I am unable to delete - only re-upload. </p>

<p>What could this possibly be? I have checked my certificates and my API key is correct. It was working 100% 10 hours ago.</p>

<p>Could this be a Firebase problem, or how would I solve this? Help is much appreciated.</p>

"Android Emulator Seems to Record Audio at 96khz

<p>My app is recording audio from phone's microphones and does some real time processing on it. It's working fine on physical devices, but acts ""funny"" in emulator. It records something, but I'm not quite sure what it is it's recording. </p>

<p><strong>It appears that on emulator the audio samples are being read at about double the rate as on actual devices.</strong> In the app I have a visual progress widget (a horizontally moving recording head), which moves about twice as fast in emulator. </p>

<p>Here is the recording loop:</p>

<pre><code>int FREQUENCY = 44100;
int BLOCKSIZE = 110;

int bufferSize = AudioRecord.getMinBufferSize(FREQUENCY,
        AudioFormat.CHANNEL_IN_STEREO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT) * 10;

AudioRecord audioRecord = new AudioRecord(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.CAMCORDER,
        FREQUENCY, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_IN_STEREO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT,
        bufferSize);

short[] signal = new short[BLOCKSIZE * 2]; // Times two for stereo

audioRecord.startRecording();

while (!isCancelled()) {
    int bufferReadResult = audioRecord.read(signal, 0, BLOCKSIZE * 2);
    if (bufferReadResult != BLOCKSIZE * 2)
        throw new RuntimeException(""Recorded less than BLOCKSIZE x 2 samples:""
                + bufferReadResult);

    // process the `signal` array here
}

audioRecord.stop();
audioRecord.release();
</code></pre>

<p>The audio source is set to ""CAMCORDER"" and it records in stereo. The idea is, if the phone has multiple microphones, the app will process data from both and use whichever has better SNR. But I have the same problems if recording mono from <code>AudioSource.MIC</code>. It reads audio data in a <code>while</code> loop, I am assuming that <code>audioRecord.read()</code> is a blocking call and will not let me read same data twice.</p>

<p>The recorded data looks OK – the record buffer contains 16-bit PCM samples for two channels. The loop just seems to be running at twice the speed as on real devices. Which leads me to think that maybe the emulator is using a higher sampling rate than the specified 44100Hz. If I query the sample rate with <code>audioRecord.getSampleRate()</code> it returns the correct value. </p>

<p>Also there are some interesting audio related messages in logcat while recording:</p>

<pre><code>07-13 12:22:02.282  1187  1531 D AudioFlinger: mixer(0xf44c0000) throttle end: throttle time(154)

<p>I'm using up-to-date Android Studio and Android SDK, and I have tried emulator images running API levels 21-24. My dev environment is Ubuntu 16.04</p>

"IPv6 - county detection

I have a CSV file downloaded from Maxmind which contains IPv6 data. I need to upload it to MySql table and then use this table to detect a country by IPv6.

So the first question is what the MySql type should be LONGSTART and LONGEND fields in my MySQL table as max INTEGER length can be of 20 while I have 42540488558116655331872044393019998208 number?

And the other question is how to build a MySql query in order to find an IP address between LONGSTART and LONGEND? I use a function( ipv6_numeric($ip) ) which converts '2001::11ff:ffff:f' IPv6 address into a long number like 2540488558116655331872044393019998208.

"How does Lombok.val actually work?

<p><a href=""https://projectlombok.org/features/val.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lombok.val</a> allows you to </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>use val as the type of a local variable declaration instead of
  actually writing the type. When you do this, the type will be inferred from the initializer expression. The local variable will also be made final.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So instead of </p>

<pre><code>final ArrayList&lt;String&gt; example = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>You can write</p>

<pre><code>val example = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I've tried to do some research into how this actually works but there doesn't seem to be a huge amount of information. Looking at <a href=""https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/blob/master/src/core/lombok/val.java"" rel=""noreferrer"">the github page</a>, I can see that <code>val</code> is an annotation type. The annotation <em>type</em> is then used, rather than an actual annotation.</p>

<p>I wasn't even aware you could even use annotation types in this manner but upon testing it the following code is indeed valid. However, I'm still not sure why you would ever want to use the type in this way.</p>

        Foo bar;
        System.out.println(""End"");
    }
}

<p>How does Lombok process these usages if they are not annotations, but annotation <em>types</em>? To my (obviously incorrect) understanding, the syntax should look more like:</p>

<pre><code>@Val foo = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
</code></pre>

"Questions about the order of execution of this code snippet

<p>So I been reading a tutorial about Javascript promises these days.</p>

<p>here is an example from it used to explain the macrotask queue(i.e. the event loop) and the microtask queue.</p>

<pre><code>let promise = Promise.reject(new Error(""Promise Failed!""));
promise.catch(err =&gt; alert('caught'));

// no error, all quiet
window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', event =&gt; alert(event.reason));
</code></pre>

<p>It says that because <code>promise.catch</code> catches the error so the last line, the event handler never gets to run. I can understand this. But then he tweaked this example a little bit.</p>

<pre><code>let promise = Promise.reject(new Error(""Promise Failed!""));
setTimeout(() =&gt; promise.catch(err =&gt; alert('caught')));

// Error: Promise Failed!
window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', event =&gt; alert(event.reason));
</code></pre>

<p>This time he says the event handler is gonna run first and catch the error and <strong>after</strong> this the <code>promise.catch</code> catches the error eventually.</p>

<p>What I do not understand about the second example is, why did the event handler run before the <code>promise.catch</code>? </p>

<p>My understanding is,</p>

<ol>
<li>Line one, we first encounter a promise, and we put it on the microtask queue.</li>
<li>Line two, we have a <code>setTimeout</code>, we put it on the macrotask queue,</li>
<li>Line three, we have an event handler, and we put the handler on the macrotask queue waiting to be fired</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, because microtask has higher priority than macrotask. We run the promise first. After it, we dequeue the first task on macrotask queue, which is the <code>setTimeout</code>. So from my understanding, the error should be caught by the function inside <code>setTimeout</code>.</p>

"Compare two Columns using index position in R

[![The dataframe][1]][1]

I have a scenario where I have to compare two columns in a dataframe. The condition is that the Field1 column has a set of values. Field2 column has few values and the remaining are NA. There is another column called Field3. So, the work here is to compare the Field1 values with Field2. The conditions to compare are as follows.

 1. If Field1 has a corresponding row in Field2. Copy the row value of Field2.
    Ex. Location and Place. So, I have to copy Place.

 2. If Field1 does not have a corresponding Field2 value. Then compare Field1 
    with Field3. Copy the Field3 value to Field2.

Kindly suggest a way to go about this.`dft = data.frame(Field1 = c(""Location"",""Time"",""Date"",""Problem""), Field2 = c(""Place"",""Balance"",""NA"",""NA""),
          Field3 = c(""NA"",""NA"",""Pay"",""NA""))`

"How do I create a ""not"" filter in python for pandas

<p>I have this large dataframe I've imported into pandas and I want to chop it down via a filter.  Here is my basic sample code:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas import Series, DataFrame

df = DataFrame({'A':[12345,0,3005,0,0,16455,16454,10694,3005],'B':[0,0,0,1,2,4,3,5,6]})

df2= df[df[""A""].map(lambda x: x &gt; 0) &amp; (df[""B""] &gt; 0)]
</code></pre>

<p>Basically this displays bottom 4 results which is semi-correct.  But I need to display everything BUT these results.  So essentially, I'm looking for a way to use this filter but in a ""not"" version if that's possible.  So if column A is greater than 0 AND column B is greater than 0 then we want to disqualify these values from the dataframe.  Thanks</p>

"Java: Allowed statements after labels

<p>I'm playing around with Java Syntax, so this is question arises purely from curiosity. This piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.google.com
Object val = 5 &lt;- 4;
</code></pre>

<p>does <strong>not</strong> compile, because a label (<code>http</code>) ""must be followed by a statement"". The following two variants do compile:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.google.com
{ Object val = 5 &lt;- 4; }
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>Object val;
http://www.google.com
val = 5 &lt;- 4;
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, I switched from a declaration to an expression.
This makes me wonder what exactly is a ""statement"" in Java, but the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/expressions.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">doc</a>
states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to expression statements, there are two other kinds of statements: declaration statements and control flow statements. A declaration statement declares a variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.7"" rel=""noreferrer"">JLS</a> just says (on labels) that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Identifier is declared to be the label of the immediately contained Statement. </p>

"Split string on one use of a word and not the other

<p>fairly novice here, I'm looking for an effective way to use split() to split a string after a certain word. 
I'm working on a voice controlled filter using the Csound API in python, and say my input command is ""Set cutoff to 440"", I'd like to split the string after the word ""to"", basically meaning that I can say the command however I like and it'll still find my frequency I'm looking for, I hope that makes sense. 
So at the moment, my code for this is</p>

<pre><code>string = ""set cutoff to 440""
split = string.split(""to"")
print(split)

<p>and my output is</p>

<p>The problem is the 'to' in 'cutoff', I know I could fix this by just changing cutoff to frequency but it seems like giving in too easily.

<p>The above is showing me an output within the notebook, but still throws : <code>ValueError: Out of range float values are not JSON compliant</code></p>

<p>And also it doesn't (hence?) produce the output file as well. How do I get rid of this error for this small subset? Is it related to NaN values? Would that also solve the 'white screen of death' issue for the larger dataset?</p>

<p>Thanks vm for taking a look!</p>

"Find most efficient groups of pairs

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>I have a group of people, and I want each person to have a 1:1 meeting with every other person in the group. A given person can only meet with one other person at a time, so I want to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find every possible pairing combination</li>
<li>Group pairs together into ""rounds"" of meetings, where each person can only be in a round once, and where a round should contain as many pairs as possible to satisfy all possible pairing combinations in the smallest number of rounds.</li>
</ol>

<p>To demonstrate the problem in terms of desired input/output, let's say I have the following list:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; people = ['Dave', 'Mary', 'Susan', 'John']
</code></pre>

<p>I want to produce the following output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for round in make_rounds(people):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     print(round)
[('Dave', 'Mary'), ('Susan', 'John')]
[('Dave', 'Susan'), ('Mary', 'John')]
[('Dave', 'John'), ('Mary', 'Susan')]
</code></pre>

<p>If I had an odd number of people, then I would expect this result:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; people = ['Dave', 'Mary', 'Susan']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for round in make_rounds(people):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     print(round)
[('Dave', 'Mary')]
[('Dave', 'Susan')]
[('Mary', 'Susan')]
</code></pre>

<p>The key to this problem is that I need my solution to be performant (within reason). I've written code that <em>works</em>, but as the size of <code>people</code> grows it becomes exponentially slow. I don't know enough about writing performant algorithms to know whether my code is inefficient, or whether I'm simply bound by the parameters of the problem</p>

<h2>What I've tried</h2>

<p>Step 1 is easy: I can get all possible pairings using <code>itertools.combinations</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import combinations
&gt;&gt;&gt; people_pairs = set(combinations(people, 2))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(people_pairs)
{('Dave', 'Mary'), ('Dave', 'Susan'), ('Dave', 'John'), ('Mary', 'Susan'), ('Mary', 'John'), ('Susan', 'John')}
</code></pre>

<p>To work out the rounds themselves, I'm building a round like so:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an empty <code>round</code> list</li>
<li>Iterate over a copy of the <code>people_pairs</code> set calculated using the <code>combinations</code> method above</li>
<li>For each person in the pair, check if there are any existing pairings inside the current <code>round</code> that already contain that individual</li>
<li>If there's already a pair that contains one of the individuals, skip that pairing for this round. If not, add the pair to the round, and remove the pair from the <code>people_pairs</code> list.</li>
<li>Once all the people pairs have been iterated over, append the round to a master <code>rounds</code> list</li>
<li>Start again, since <code>people_pairs</code> now contains only the pairs that didn't make it into the first round</li>
</ol>

<p>Eventually this produces the desired result, and whittles down my people pairs until there are none left and all the rounds are calculated. I can already see that this is requiring a ridiculous number of iterations, but I don't know a better way of doing this.</p>

<p>Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import combinations

# test if person already exists in any pairing inside a round of pairs
def person_in_round(person, round):
    is_in_round = any(person in pair for pair in round)
    return is_in_round

def make_rounds(people):
    people_pairs = set(combinations(people, 2))
    # we will remove pairings from people_pairs whilst we build rounds, so loop as long as people_pairs is not empty
    while people_pairs:
        round = []
        # make a copy of the current state of people_pairs to iterate over safely
        for pair in set(people_pairs):
            if not person_in_round(pair[0], round) and not person_in_round(pair[1], round):
                round.append(pair)
                people_pairs.remove(pair)
        yield round
</code></pre>

<p>Plotting out the performance of this method for list sizes of 100-300 using <a href=""https://mycurvefit.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://mycurvefit.com</a> shows that calculating rounds for a list of 1000 people would probably take around 100 minutes. Is there a more efficient way of doing this?</p>

<p>Note: I'm not <em>actually</em> trying to organise a meeting of 1000 people :) this is just a simple example that represents the matching / combinatorics problem I'm trying to solve. </p>

"How to set default parameters for a graphical device?

<p>I like to read white on black. So, in R I would do something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>par (bg = ""black"")
par (fg = ""ivory1"")
</code></pre>

<p>I would like these options to be set by default. However, one does not simply write these lines in <code>.Rprofile</code> because, as I understand, at the time it gets executed, the graphical device is not yet initialized. Rather, as suggested in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/13480570/2108477"">another answer</a>, one should re-assign <code>options()$device</code> to include the necessary option setting. I did not have success in that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is what I tried:</p>

<p><em><code>~/.Rprofile</code></em></p>

<pre><code>f_device &lt;- options()$device

blackdevice &lt;- function (...) {

    f_device(...)

    par (bg       = ""black"")
    par (fg       = ""ivory1"")
}

options (device = blackdevice)
</code></pre>

<p>The idea here is to save the original <code>device</code> function to another variable, and then call it from my new <code>device</code> function. What I get is:</p>

<pre><code>Error in f_device(...) : could not find function ""f_device""
</code></pre>

<p>— At the time I run <code>plot (something)</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another idea I had is to go like that:</p>

<p><em><code>~/.Rprofile</code></em></p>

<pre><code>.First &lt;- function () {

    options(f_device = options()$device)

    blackdevice &lt;- function (...) {

        options()$f_device(...)

        par (bg       = ""black"")
        par (fg       = ""ivory1"")
    }

    options (device = blackdevice)
}
</code></pre>

<p>— Assigning the original <code>device</code> someplace else in <code>options</code>. But this leads to:</p>

<pre><code>Error in (function (...)  : attempt to apply non-function

"Warning: function result variable of a managed type does not seem to initialized

I am unfortunately required to use pascal for university to create programs, the task I have requires me to create two routines one of which reads in data from a terminal and the other outputs data to the terminal, and another two routines which utilize an array to loop through these two routines to perform them multiple times. The issue I am having is that the terminal crashes after one run though of the ReadComputer function instead of looping multiple times. the compiler is also providing me the following warning: ""Warning: function result variable of a managed type does not seem to initialized"" although after extensive research and due to the fact that no one uses pascal I cannot find a solution.

"Struct with another struct inside of it in python Ctypes

I am developing a ratchet control software, it uses a dll called xpcomlib, and has examples of use in C. I am developing in Python and for the use of the DLL I am using Ctypes, I was able to do as eg the same needs from one pointeiro to one structure and one structure has another. Let's make it clearer.

**Here's a part of the manual**

    int FAR PASCAL FXPBasicConvFromText(
      const char FAR* szFileOrig, // Source File name will be converted
      const char FAR* szFileDest, // Dest file name will be converted
      CONVFILEFORMAT FAR* pF // Pointer to source file format
    );
The **'pF'** argument is a pointer to a structure of type **CONVFILEFORMAT** that defines the format of the source file. **cFields** Number of fields in the source file, must be between 1 and 10. For each of the 'cFields' fields above we have the **'Field' structure** defined by:

    struct {
       cName [11]     Field name only for conversions with destination file type DBF
       cType         Field type XPFLD_INT, XPFLD_FLO, XPFLD_STR. See XPCOMxx.H.
       cLength        Length of field
       cDec           Number of decimal places used for floating point in file conversion
    XPbasic format for DBASE format
    } Field [10];

**Example made in the manual**

    #include <windows.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include “xpcom16.h”
    char szInFile[20];
    char szOutFile[20];
    CONVFILEFORMAT fF;
    int PASCAL WinMain(HANDLE hInstance, HANDLE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
    {
    fF.cFields = 3;
    fF.Field[0].cType = XPFLD_STR;
    fF.Field[0].cLength = 80;
    fF.Field[0].cDec = 0;
    fF.Field[1].cType = XPFLD_INT;
    fF.Field[1].cLength = 2;
    fF.Field[1].cDec = 0;
    fF.Field[2].cType = XPFLD_FLO;
    fF.Field[2].cLength = 8;
    fF.Field[2].cDec = 0;
    strcpy(szInFile, “C:\\TRIX\\ARQTXT.DAT”);
    strcpy(szOutFile, “C:\\TRIX\\ARQXPB.DAT”);
    if (FXPBasicConvFromText(szInFile, szOutFile, &fF))
    return FALSE;
    return TRUE;
    }

**Given this, I need to make use of the dll in python, so far I have done this**

    class ConvFileField(ctypes.Structure):
        _fields_ = [(""cName"", ctypes.c_char_p), (""cType"", ctypes.c_byte), (""cLength"", ctypes.c_byte), (""cDec"", ctypes.c_byte)]
    
    class Struct(ctypes.Structure):
        _fields_ = [(""cFields"", ctypes.c_byte), (""Field"", ctypes.POINTER(ConvFileField))]   
    
        elems = (ConvFileField * 10)()
        Field = ctypes.cast(elems, ctypes.POINTER(ConvFileField))
    
    formatPointer = ctypes.POINTER(Struct)
    formatPointer.cFields = 0 #Works
    formatPointer.Field[0].cType = 1 #Doesn't work

However I get the following error saying that my structure does not contain the Field field, with the above cFields working normal.

"What is the fastest way to see if a node has a child with a specific tag in javascript?

I want to check if a node has a certain tag in itself or one of it's children in Javascript. 

    <html>
         <body>
             <p>
                 <h3><a> This link lead nowhere!</a> </h3>
             </p>
         </body>
    </html>

For example, in the above code, if I was given the node which is responsible for the p tag, and want to check if it has a link in it, what would be the fastest way to just check that (without having the actual node for the link)?

If the given node's name was ""node"", would it be faster to do:

    function nodeContainsTag(node) {
        return node.tagName == ""A"" || node.getElementsByTagName(""a"").length > 0 ;
    }
or

    function nodeContainsTag(node) {
        return node.outerHTML.indexOf(""<a"") > 0;
    }

Is the second function even guaranteed to work (i.e. do I need to check case sensitivity(`""<A""`) and spacing (ex: `""< a""`))?",LQ

"how to make array's each ""string"" elements first character on uppercase and the remaining characters on lowercase?

This is about the title case algorithm which I extended further,I need the most efficient implementation in JavaScript it should be extensible and scalable.

for example I have a random array content such as:
var arr = [""hell o"", ""3are"", ""you a"",""modern"",""332developer""];
 

if the element ""contents"" starts with a number then it should neglect that index and move to the next index until it finds the first letter and convert it to an uppercase, remaining letters in the word should be in lower case, if there is space after a word in the content then it should consider that a new word and the same Algorithm.

Achieving below results:

  var arr = [""Hell O"", ""3Are"", ""You A"",""Modern"",""332Developer""];

 This is just an example of array contents you may use any value as you like the most important thing is to solve the Algorithm.",LQ

"Legitimate reason for comparing floats?

I seem to see people asking all the time around here questions about floating point numbers and comparing them.....the canonical answer is always: just see if the numbers are within some small number of eachother..........

So the question is this:  Why would you ever need to know if two floating point numbers are equal to eachother?   

In all my years of coding I have never needed to do this (although I will admit that even *I* am not omniscient).  From my point of view if you are trying to use floating point numbers for and for some reason want to know if the numbers are equal, you should probably be using an integer type (or a decimal type in languages that support it).

<p>So far what I've done was created a series of loops that generates a date range between the min date of the product lifecycle and the max date of all products. I then append the last recorded row values as a new row with a new date if there is no information for said new date. I append these to lists, and then generate a new dataframe with the updated lists. The code is terribly slow and takes 2+ hours to complete on the total dataset:</p>

<pre><code>date_list = []
pid_list= []
time_stamp_list = []
delta_qty_list = []
resulting_qty_list = []


timer = len(test.product_id.unique().tolist())
counter = 0
for product in test.product_id.unique().tolist():
    counter+=1
    print((counter/timer)*100)
    temp_df = test.query(f'product_id=={product}', engine='python')
    for idx,date in enumerate(pd.date_range(temp_df.index.min(),test.index.max()).tolist()):
        min_date= temp_df.index.min()
        if date.date() == min_date:
            date2=min_date
            pid = temp_df.loc[date2]['product_id']
            timestamp = temp_df.loc[date2]['timestamp']
            delta_qty = temp_df.loc[date2]['delta_qty']

"Target Boost::<library> already has an imported location + link errors

<p>I'm using Homebrew to install LLVM, Boost, and CMake on MacOS Mojave. After upgrading my LLVM to version 9.0.0 and Boost to 1.71.0, CMake (v3.15.3) started complaining about various libraries already having an imported location, such as:</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out where the latency in my calls is coming from, please let me know if any of this information could be presented in a format that is more clear!</p>

<p>Some background: I have two systems--System A and System B. I manually (through Postman) hit an endpoint on System A that invokes an endpoint on System B. 
System A is hosted on an EC2 instance. </p>

<ul>
<li>When System B is hosted on a Lambda function behind API Gateway, the
latency for the call is 125 ms.  </li>
<li>When System B is hosted on an
EC2 instance, the latency for the call is 8 ms.  </li>
<li>When System B is
hosted on an EC2 instance behind API Gateway, the latency for the
call is 100 ms.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, my hypothesis is that API Gateway is the reason for increased latency when it's paired with the Lambda function as well. Can anyone confirm if this is the case, and if so, what is API Gateway doing that increases the latency so much? Is there any way around it? Thank you!</p>

"Is re-exporting modules harmful for tree-shaking?

<p>I've come into an argument with my co-workers for which we can't seem to find an answer from any official source (MDN, webpack documentation, ...). My research <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38077164/es6-export-from-import"">hasn't yielded much</a> either. There seems to be doubt <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42051588/wildcard-or-asterisk-vs-named-or-selective-import-es6-javascript"">even when it comes to importing</a> as well.</p>

<p>Our setup is Webpack, Babel, and a typical React / Redux app. Take this example:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>export * from './actions';
export * from './selectors';
export * from './reducer';

export { default } from './reducer';
</code></pre>

<p>This allows me to separate a Redux module into logical sections, making the code easier to read and maintain.</p>

<p>However, it is believed by some of my co-workers that <code>export * from</code> may, in fact, harm <code>webpack</code>'s tree-shaking capabilities, by tricking it into believing an export is used when it is in fact just being re-exported.</p>

"Download pdf file inside WebView using AdvancedWebview

I'm struggling a lot on getting to download files inside an webView when link is clicked within it. I searched many forums and mostly they work when I run application in Bluestacks emulater but when I installed it in device, only Downloading file appears and nothing happens after that.

Then I came across Advancced webView but I have no clue what to write inside if and else statement to get what I desires 

Here is the code from library to initiate download

    public void onDownloadRequested(String url, String suggestedFilename, String mimeType, long contentLength, String contentDisposition, String userAgent) {
    // some file is available for download
    // either handle the download yourself or use the code below

    if (AdvancedWebView.handleDownload(this, url, suggestedFilename)) {
        // download successfully handled
    }
    else {
        // download couldn't be handled because user has disabled download manager app on the device
        // TODO show some notice to the user
    }
}

and my manifest file is

I'm currently working on this [website][1], in the project section there are 3 columns, i already set the scale to change when hoovering over one of it, but my client requested that the middle column need to be already scaled when the page is opened for the first time, and after hoovering on the one on the left or on the right, the middle column get back to the original scale, the same as the other. 

Is possible? 

the correct way should be:

0= Original scale 

1= Bigger scale 

First view of the page->[ 0| 1 |0 ]  --hoovering in another column-->[ 1| 0 |0 ] --not hoovering in a column->[ 0| 0 |0 ]

"How to profile django channels?

<p>My technology stack is Redis as a channels backend, Postgresql as a database, Daphne as an ASGI server, Nginx in front of a whole application. Everything is deployed using Docker Swarm, with only Redis and Database outside. I have about 20 virtual hosts, with 20 interface servers, 40 http workers and 20 websocket workers. Load balancing is done using Ingress overlay Docker network. </p>

<p>The problem is, sometimes very weird things happen regarding performance. Most of requests are handled in under 400ms, but sometimes request can take up to 2-3s, even during very small load. Profiling workers with Django Debug Toolbar or middleware-based profilers shows nothing (timing 0.01s or so)</p>

<p>My question: is there any good method of profiling a whole request path with django-channels? I would like how much time each phase takes, i.e when request was processed by Daphne, when worker started processing, when it finished, when interface server sent response to the client. Currently, I have no idea how to solve this. </p>

"How to link push button and a new window by coding using QT?

First of all, I created about 20 push buttons using for loop. And named them using if else loop. Now, I want to connect each push buttons with the new dialog box.

But, I don't know the name of the pushbutton I made as the for and if else loop made it. The connect(ui-> .......) also doesn't show any predictions.

"Maze won't backtrack [Python]

There are a couple of maze questions similar to this one but none of them ever really go into the why it won't work.

This is for an assignment for my summer class. I don't need precise answers. I just need to know why this particular thing doesn't work.

This is the bit of my class Maze that I need help with.

ysize in my example is 10
xsize is 10
xend is 20 (changing it to 19 messes with the results and doesn't draw anything)
yend is 10 (changing it to 9 does this too)


'''

    def solve(self, x, y):
        
        
        if y > (self.ysize) or x > (self.xsize):
            print(""1"")
            return False
        
        if self.maze[y][x] == self.maze[self.yend][self.xend]:
            print(""2"")
            return True 
    
        if self.maze[y][x] != "" "":
            print(""3"")
            return False
        
    
    
        self.maze[y][x] = ""o"" # MARKING WITH o for path already taken.
        
        if self.solve(x+1,y) == True:  

            return True
        elif self.solve(x,y+1) == True: 

            return True
        elif self.solve(x-1,y) == True:

            return True
        elif self.solve(x,y-1) == True: 

            return True
        
        self.maze[y][x] = "" "" # ELSE I want it to be replaced with space
        
        return False


'''

The expected result is the solved maze with a trailing path of ""o"" from 1 1 to 9 19 as per the current file. 
However what I get is a path from 1 1 to 13 4 (x)(y) format.
There is a dead end around 13 4 and it won't backtrack to go up and left. Sorry if it doesn't make that much sense but copy pasting the drawing doesn't turn out well.",LQ

"Dynamic Programming - Minimum number of coins in C

<p>I have looked through various questions on the site and I haven't managed to find anything which implements this by the following reasoning (so I hope this isn't a duplicate).</p>

<p>The problem I'm trying to solve via a C program is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the programmer of a vending machine controller your are required to compute the minimum number of coins that make up the required change to give back to customers. An efficient solution to this problem takes a dynamic programming approach, starting off computing the number of coins required for a 1 cent change, then for 2 cents, then for 3 cents, until reaching the required change and each time making use of the prior computed number of coins. Write a program containing the function <code>ComputeChange()</code>, that takes a list of valid coins and the required change. This program should repeatedly ask for the required change from the console and call <code>ComputeChange()</code> accordingly. It should also make use of “caching”, where any previously computed intermediate values are retained for subsequent look-up.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have searched thoroughly on SO and the solutions posted for other's with similar questions are not working for me here.</p>

<p>I am writing my own custom 'string-like' class in C++, and am encoutering the following errors when compiling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>./PyString.h:8:11: error: out-of-line declaration of 'PyString' does
  not match any declaration in 'PyString' PyString::PyString (char*);
            ^</p>

  <p>pystring.cpp:4:7: error: redefinition of 'PyString' class PyString {</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the first and second errors, moving around the destructor into the class definition itself in the <code>cpp</code> file did not work.</p>

<p>As for the third error, I can't seem to fix it - I'm not redefining the class!</p>

<p>Here is <code>pystring.h</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef PYSTRING_INCLUDED
#define PYSTRING_INCLUDED

class PyString {
    char* string;
};

PyString::PyString (char*);
PyString::~PyString (void);

#endif
</code></pre>

<p>Here is <code>pystring.cpp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""PyString.h""
#define NULL 0

class PyString {
    char* string = NULL;
  public:
    PyString(char inString) {
      string = new char[inString];
    };

"Chrome NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID error on self signing certificate at LocalHost

<p>I am trying to setup a development environment on my local PC. As the production website supports HTTPS (who does not these days?), I want to have this also on the localhost. I thought it would be easy, but no.</p>

<p>I have a XAMP installation, and setup all so I can access the website. However, whenever I go to any page on the site locally, I get the chrome warning:</p>

<p>NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7580508/getting-chrome-to-accept-self-signed-localhost-certificate"">Getting Chrome to accept self-signed localhost certificate</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://deliciousbrains.com/https-locally-without-browser-privacy-errors/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://deliciousbrains.com/https-locally-without-browser-privacy-errors/</a></p>

<p>After that, I generated the CER or P7B file and imported that into Chrome. I restarted both Apache and Chrome.</p>

<p>I put the certificate in the Trusted Root Certificate Authorities. Somehow, Chrome decided however to place it in the Intermediate Root Certificate Authorities...</p>

<p>I am using Chrome 61, I had the same in 60.</p>

<p>So somehow I am unable to install a self signed certificate, and keep getting this warning which basically makes development on localhost impossible...</p>

<p>I understand that this self-signing is not exactly trustworthy, but there must be a way to develop offline? It does not make sense that we have to build websites online from now on?...</p>

"(Java)How can I check if an 2d array contains a certain line?

If given a 2D array, for example int[][] arr = {{2,3}, {53, 2}, {23,13}}; how can i check if the row {53, 2} exist in the array? 
I have the following code:

```
int[][] arr = {{1, 3}, {2, 2}, {2, 5}, {3, 1}, {3, 4}, {3, 7}, {4, 3}, {4, 6}, {5, 2}, {5, 5},

"In Python, like in most languages, you access the first item in a list with 0. But would starting at 1 have been a better choice?

<p>Like in most languages, the first item in a Python list (or string) is indexed at 0. But does this design make sense given that one can access the last item in a list (or string) with the value -1.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>my_list = list(""Madam Im Adam"")
print(my_list[0]) 
# prints M
print(my_list[-1]) 
# prints m
</code></pre>

<p>Given that Python allows programmers to access the end of a list using negative values wouldn't it make sense to have broken with convention and designed Python so that list indexes started at 1?  Examine for example this simple algorithm to identify palindromes:</p>

<pre><code>phrase = ""madam im adam""
for i in range(0, len(phrase ) // 2):   
    if phrase [i] != phrase [-i - 1]:   #awkward!!!! (why not just -i?)
        is_palindrome = False

if is_palindrome:
    print(""It's a palindrome"")
else:
    print(""It's NOT a palindrome"")
</code></pre>

<p>If list and string indexes started at 1 instead of 0 the above algorithm with this awkward line:</p>

<pre><code>if phrase [i] != phrase [-i - 1]:
</code></pre>

<p>could simply be written as:</p>

<pre><code>if phrase [i] != phrase [-i]:
</code></pre>

<p>Which is much simpler to read and comprehend. So is this a design flaw in Python?  </p>

<p>(Guido van Rossum probably had reasons to start list indices at 0. If he wanted to retain that orthodox functionality, but also make a language where palindrome algorithms were simple to write would it have made any sense for him to specify that the last item in a list be accessed with the value -0 instead of -1?  Or does -0 in this context introduce even more problems and complications?)  </p>

"Algorithm to detect more than one sequence of 4 same letters horizontally, vertically or diagonally

I have been assigned a task to write an algorithm to detect if a given array of strings contains more than one sequence of 4 repeated letters horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They also asked me the most efficient way to do it.

An input example would be something like this:

`String[] input = {""ATGCGA"",""CAGTGC"",""TTATGT"",""AGAAGG"",""CCCCTA"",""TCACTG""};`

but you guys can see it more clearly like a table here:

A T G C G A

C A G T G C

T T A T G T

A G A A G G

C C C C T A

T C A C T G

This array contains 3 sequences with a repeated letter:

AAAA is found diagonally
CCCC is found horizontally
GGGG is found vertically

So, since there are more than 1 sequence found in this input example, the output should be true.


I have an idea to solve this problem but my major issue is handling the diagonals, especially using an efficient way to do it since they expect to use this function in a high concurrency environment.

I would be grateful for any help provided. It's ok if someone can't write the code, but at least some ideas to get the right approach to solve this problem.

"How to convert a double to a unint8 with 2 decimal

Some functions return double with 6 decimal

> 23.565437

I need to convert it to uint8_t, but I gess that uint8 does not keep the decimal

I tried the following

    double luminosity;
    uint8_t lum;
    lum = (uint8_t)luminosity;

if luminosity has a value of 23.45567
lum return 23

Is there a way that lum return 23.45 with to decimal.

if not, is there a way to convert to bits
1. to keep to decimal = 23.45
2. to convert to bit = 32 33 2e 34 35
3. and to save it to lum?

In that way lum will hav the value of 

> 32 33 2e 34 35

 
which is 

> 23.45

I am very novice for a such convertion...

"Javascript: Combining Strings into Array

<p>I have 3 strings that I need to convert into a single array, from there I want to filter out the <code>type: ""bundle""</code>. </p>

<p>I need to note that I'm using Javascript Code by Zapier and their javascript library is a bit limited as far as the functions that I can use, but this is what I have so far which works if I hard code <code>itemArray</code>. I'm just having trouble creating my <code>itemArray</code> from the 3 given strings:</p>

<p>Strings:</p>

<pre><code>var type  = 'bundle, simple, simple';
var name  = 'Product1, Product2, Product3';
var price = '1.99, 2.99, 3.99';

        {type:""simple"", info: {name: ""Product2"", price: ""2.99""}},
        {type:""simple"", info: {name: ""Product3"", price: ""3.99""}}];

var filtered = [];
for (var i = 0; i &lt; itemArray.length; ++i) {
    var item = itemArray[i];
    if (item.type == 'simple') filtered.push(item);
}

return {filtered}; //this returns just the 2 simple product type arrays

"How to preprocess text for embedding?

<p>In the traditional ""one-hot"" representation of words as vectors you have a vector of the same dimension as the cardinality of your vocabulary. To reduce dimensionality usually stopwords are removed, as well as applying stemming, lemmatizing, etc. to normalize the features you want to perform some NLP task on.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble understanding whether/how to preprocess text to be embedded (e.g. word2vec). My goal is to use these word embeddings as features for a NN to classify texts into topic A, not topic A, and then perform event extraction on them on documents of topic A (using a second NN).</p>

<p>My first instinct is to preprocess removing stopwords, lemmatizing stemming, etc. But as I learn about NN a bit more I realize that applied to natural language, the CBOW and skip-gram models would in fact require the whole set of words to be present --to be able to predict a word from context one would need to know the actual context, not a reduced form of the context after normalizing... right?). The actual sequence of POS tags seems to be key for a human-feeling prediction of words.</p>

<p>I've found <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/word2vec-toolkit/TI-TQC-b53w"" rel=""noreferrer"">some guidance online</a> but I'm still curious to know what the community here thinks:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any recent commonly accepted best practices regarding punctuation, stemming, lemmatizing, stopwords, numbers, lowercase etc?</li>
<li>If so, what are they? Is it better in general to process as little as possible, or more on the heavier side to normalize the text? Is there a trade-off?</li>
</ol>

<p>My thoughts: </p>

<p>It is better to remove punctuation (but e.g. in Spanish don't remove the accents because the do convey contextual information), change written numbers to numeric, do not lowercase everything (useful for entity extraction), no stemming, no lemmatizing. </p>

<p>Does this sound right?</p>

"Return value of function strlen() ?

This is the definition of strlen i have goggled up.
strlen( ) function counts the number of characters in a given string and returns the integer value. It stops counting the character when null character is found.
Now according to me the strlen for ""kshitij"" should be = 7 i.e not including the null character because the function stops counting as and when it encounters the null character.
Therefore if I want to print the word ""kshitij"" and its reverse as many times as the letters in the word, then the correct code should be.

 
    #include<iostream.h>
    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<conio.h>
    #include<string.h>
    int main()
    {
    char a[1000];
    gets(a);
    int len=strlen(a);
        for(int i=0; i<= len ; i++)
        {
        for(int j=len ; j>=0; j--)
        {
        cout<<a[j];
        }
        cout<<"" "";
        }
        getch();
     return 0;
     }


accordingly it provides the reasonably correct output.(Apart of spacing I don’t understand)
 

[enter image description here][1]


now I was curious to know what would it print if  i did :


     #include<iostream.h>
     #include<stdio.h>
     #include<conio.h>
     #include<string.h>
     int main()
     {
     char a[1000];
     gets(a);
     int len=strlen(a);
       for(int i=0; i<= len ; i++)
       {
       for(int j=len -1 ; j>=0; j--)
       {
       cout<<a[j];
       }
       cout<<"" "";
       }
       getch();
     return 0;
     }

 
which according to me should not produce the last letter which is ""j"" but what i see is that it produces the same output but 1 less spacing then before.


[enter image description here][2]
 

similarly i tried :


     #include<iostream.h>
     #include<stdio.h>
     #include<conio.h>
     #include<string.h>
     int main()
     {
     char a[1000];
     gets(a);
     int len=strlen(a);
        for(int i=0; i<= len - 1  ; i++)
        {
        for(int j=len ; j>=0; j--)
        {
        cout<<a[j];
        }
        cout<<"" "";
        }
        getch();
     return 0;
     }

[enter image description here][3]

over here according to me the ouput should contain only "" 7 - 1 = 6 "" times the reverse string but the ouput almost the same.The -1 has no effect on the value of ""len"".
 

With all this on my plate , I feel that the strlen function must count the null character as well, wiz strlen (a)= 8 (including ‘\0’), but then I see only 7 outputs in the output window.
This leaves me wondering  if the strlen function counts the null character as well or not , and if it does then it must show it as a space in the output window , i am unable to apprehend the complete concept, any help is appreciated ? 
I am new to programming please take it easy on me. Thanks :).

"Including HTML inside Jekyll tag

<p>Instead of writing out <code>{% include link_to.html i=5 text=""hello world"" %}</code> all the time, I've written a custom tag that allows me to do <code>{% link_to 5 hello world %}</code>. It finds the page with data <code>i</code> equal to 5 and creates a link to it.</p>

<p>But it feels clunky to generate HTML strings from inside the tag code, and it is awkward to write complicated code logic inside the HTML include code. So  is there a way to have the tag definition do the heavy lifting of finding the relevant page to link to, and have it pass on what it found to <code>link_to.html</code> to render? Sort of like the controller passing information on to the view in Rails.</p>

"Unable to Update UI using AsyncTask in Android

I have a `MapActivity` in my android application and I want to draw a route from source to destination followed by drawing `polyline` along the path found. I am showing a `progressDialog` while `polyline` is drawn along the path.

I think drawing polyline is a heavy task as it caused `progressDialog` to stop spinning. So I put `drawPolyline` functionality inside an `AsyncTask`.

But the problem I am facing now is I am not getting updated screen but suddenly the `MapActivity` screen blinks and disappear and I see the MainActivity now.

Why is it happening?
I want to know whether or not updating UI in AsyncTask is conceptually correct? If yes, how can we go about doing it?


**Note:** I have checked AsyncTask functionality by putting breakPoints. It is working as expected but drawPolyline causes error.
Also drawPolyline has no problem as it works fine when called without AsyncTask.

Any kind of suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

It is already compiled but it doesn't work when I want to run it.

This is the error:

So basicly it says (because I am german) that the main class can't be found or be loaded. The reason is ""java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ratespiel/Zahlraten (wrong name: Zahlraten)""

  <p>All of Octave’s comparison operators return a value of 1 if the

  work on an element-by-element basis. Broadcasting rules apply. See
  Broadcasting. For example:</p>

"Programatically create a complex JSONArray in Android?

I have been struggling trying to make this work properly. From what I have read the following example is a JSONArray. I need to be able to dynamically create such an array problematically within my Android code, so that it can output this array to a web service. I am most confused about adding the top ""header"" information and the nested ""Position"" JSONObject as the last property. I know how a basic JSONObject is created, as well as a basic JSONArray, but this combined one is really throwing me off. Any help would be much appreciated. This is the example I was given that I need to try to create:

"How to set two adapters to one RecyclerView?

<p>I am developing an android app in which I'm storing two different types of information on 'FirebaseDatabase`.</p>

<p>Then in the <code>MainActivity</code>, I'm retrieving them and showing to users in a <code>RecyclerView</code>. Both information are meant to be shown in different layouts, i.e., the layouts for both of them are different and that's why I have two make two different Model class and now have 2 different adapters. I'm using <a href=""https://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter"" rel=""noreferrer"">FastAdapter</a> by @MikePenz</p>

<p>So, what I did is I set the adapter on recyclerview in the same sequence as the information is fetched from database:</p>

<p>1.</p>

<pre><code>public void prepareDataOfSRequests() {
        gModelClass = new GModelClass(postedBy, ***, ***, ***, ""error"", ***, formattedTime, currentLatitude, currentLongitude, utcFormatDateTime, userEmail, userID, null, ***, itemID);
        fastItemAdapter.add(0, gModelClass);
        recyclerView.setAdapter(fastItemAdapter);
        recyclerView.smoothScrollToPosition(0);
        emptyRVtext.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
    }

        recyclerView.smoothScrollToPosition(0);
        emptyRVtext.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
    }

<p>as the recyclerview is only one and I'm setting 2 different adapters one by one, the recyclerview is getting updated with the 2nd adapter and showing only it's content.</p>

"Tensorflow: Confusion regarding the adam optimizer

<p>I'm confused regarding as to how the adam optimizer actually works in tensorflow.</p>

<p>The way I read the <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/api_docs/python/train.html#AdamOptimizer"" rel=""noreferrer"">docs</a>, it says that the learning rate is changed every gradient descent iteration. </p>

<p>But when I call the function I give it a learning rate. And I don't call the function to let's say, do one epoch (implicitly calling # iterations so as to go through my data training). I call the function for each batch explicitly like</p>

<pre><code>for epoch in epochs
     for batch in data
          sess.run(train_adam_step, feed_dict={eta:1e-3})
</code></pre>

<p>So my eta cannot be changing. And I'm not passing a time variable in. Or is this some sort of generator type thing where upon session creation <code>t</code> is incremented each time I call the optimizer?</p>

<p>Assuming it is some generator type thing and the learning rate is being invisibly reduced: How could I get to run the adam optimizer without decaying the learning rate? It seems to me like <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/api_docs/python/train.html#RMSPropOptimizer"" rel=""noreferrer"">RMSProp</a> is basically the same, the only thing I'd have to do to make it equal (learning rate disregarded) is to change the hyperparameters <code>momentum</code> and <code>decay</code> to match <code>beta1</code> and <code>beta2</code> respectively.

"Javascript or Jquery sum of highest 5 values

Please do not mark this question as **DUPLICATE**. I am really facing the problem.

I have an array of 6 values where 6th value is optional (i.e. if user does not input 6th value, the first 5 values will be calculated). I want to sum highest 5 values of them.

My Javascript Code:

    function calculate_merit_point(){

       var s1 = eval(document.getElementById('sub_no1').value);
	   var s2 = eval(document.getElementById('sub_no2').value);
	   var s3 = eval(document.getElementById('sub_no3').value);
	   var s4 = eval(document.getElementById('sub_no4').value);
	   var s5 = eval(document.getElementById('sub_no5').value);
	   var s6 = eval(document.getElementById('sub_no6').value);
	  
	   var vals = [s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6];
	
	  function arraySum(arr) {
		  if (!arr) {
			  return false;
		  } else {
			  var sum = 0;
			  for (var i = 0, len = arr.length; i < len; i++) {
				  sum += arr[i];
			  }
			  return sum;
		  }
	  }

	
	  sum = arraySum(vals.sort(function(a, b) {
		  return b - a;
	  }).slice(0, 5));
	
			
	  if(isNaN(tt)){
		  $('#agr').text('0');
	  } else {
		  $('#agr').text(sum);
	  }
	
	
    }


Now suppose

    s1 = 30
    s2 = 31
    s3 = 32
    s4 = 33
    s5 = 34
    s6 = 35

It should be `31+32+33+34+35 = 165`. but it is displaying the value 162.

As per my requirement (6th value optional), if I do not give any value to `s6`, it is displaying the value **228**.

"Does Java's lack of multiple inheritance hurt its potential for Android game development?

<p>I'm currently enrolled in a mobile app development class, and I have an idea for a game that I'd like to do that involves virtual pets. I'm confident that I'll be able to utilize Java's capabilities for this class without a problem, but further down the line if I wanted to, say, fuse pets and/or breed, I imagine it might become difficult to implement my ideas using Java. </p>

<p>I know that objects can inherit from multiple interfaces and there are ways of obtaining variables through other means, but in terms of code and app efficiency, would I be better off using another language down the line?</p>

<p>Really looking forward to this discussion, as I enjoy hearing the pros and cons of each side. Java's my favorite language at the moment because I'm most familiar with it, but even so... I'd love to branch out if I'd be better off doing so. I've looked this up using search engines many times but I thought this would be a more hands-on approach to engage with people in conversation as opposed to simply reading past threads. </p>

"Bootstrap 4 error ""Bootstrap dropdown require Popper.js"", with Aurelia CLI and Require.js

<p>I'm having trouble configuring Bootstrap 4 beta in an Aurelia CLI app (v0.31.1) with requirejs and using TypeScript. After having tried several config variations I keep on getting the following console error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uncaught Error: Bootstrap dropdown require Popper.js</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the steps to reproduce. First, install the packages:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install --save jquery bootstrap@4.0.0-beta popper.js
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I've configured <strong>aurelia.json</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>  ""jquery"",
  {
    ""name"": ""popper.js"",
    ""path"": ""../node_modules/popper.js/dist/umd"",
    ""main"": ""popper""
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""bootstrap"",
    ""path"": ""../node_modules/bootstrap/dist"",
    ""main"": ""js/bootstrap.min"",
    ""deps"": [
      ""jquery"",
      ""popper.js""
    ],
    ""exports"": ""$"",
    ""resources"": [
      ""css/bootstrap.css""
    ]
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Notice in the config above that: </p>

<ul>
<li>popper.js is registered before bootstrap</li>
<li>the UMD module is used</li>
<li>popper.js is set as a dependency for bootstrap, next to jquery</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, in my <strong>app.ts</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>import 'bootstrap';
</code></pre>

<p>With this configuration, building using <code>au build</code> works fine. But upon running, using <code>au run --watch</code> I get the following console errors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uncaught Error: Bootstrap dropdown require Popper.js (<a href=""https://popper.js.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://popper.js.org</a>) (defaults.js:19)<br>
  Uncaught Error: Bootstrap dropdown require Popper.js (<a href=""https://popper.js.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://popper.js.org</a>) (bootstrap.min.js:6)<br>
  ... a bit further on:<br>
  Uncaught TypeError: plugin.load is not a function at Module. (defaults.js:19)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, the Bootstrap 4 docs only mention <a href=""https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/webpack/"" rel=""noreferrer"">instructions on webpack</a>. So does a search on both Aurelia's <a href=""https://gitter.im/aurelia/Discuss"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gitter.im channel</a> and on StackOverflow. I cannot find samples regarding Aurelia CLI with Require.js. Finally, Google hits shows only examples for embedding the alpha versions (which relied on 'tethering' rather than 'popper').</p>

<p>Similar questions on SO, which have the same error but aren't applicable to my situation:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45645971/bootstrap-4-beta-importing-popper-js-with-webpack-3-x-throws-popper-is-not-a-con"">Bootstrap 4 Beta importing Popper.js with Webpack 3.x throws Popper is not a constructor</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45680644/angular-4-bootstrap-dropdown-require-popper-js"">Angular 4 Bootstrap dropdown require Popper.js</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=Bootstrap+dropdown+require+Popper.js"">And several more...</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, my question: how can I configure Bootstrap 4 with Popper.js in an Aurelia CLI app (using Require.js, not Webpack)?</p>

"Could the order of a list contained in a dictionary may vary?

I know that dictionaries may have a different order that the one which each key,value pair is inserted.

"Are C++17 Parallel Algorithms implemented already?

<p>I was trying to play around with the new parallel library features proposed in the C++17 standard, but I couldn't get it to work. I tried compiling with the up-to-date versions of <code>g++ 8.1.1</code> and <code>clang++-6.0</code> and <code>-std=c++17</code>, but neither seemed to support <code>#include &lt;execution&gt;</code>, <code>std::execution::par</code> or anything similar. </p>

<p>When looking at the <a href=""https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/parallelism"" rel=""noreferrer"">cppreference</a> for parallel algorithms there is a long list of algorithms, claiming </p>

"AOF and RDB backups in redis

<p>This question is about Redis persistence. </p>

<p>I'm using redis as a 'fast backend' for a social networking website. It's a single server set up. I've been transferring PostgreSQL responsibilities to Redis steadily. Currently in <code>etc/redis/redis.conf</code>, the appendonly setting is set to <code>appendonly no</code>. Snapshotting settings are <code>save 900 1</code>, <code>save 300 10</code>, <code>save 60 10000</code>. All this is true for production and development both. As per production logs, <code>save 60 10000</code> gets invoked heavily. Does this mean that practically, I'm getting backups every 60 seconds?</p>

<p>Some literature suggests using AOF and RDB backups together. Thus I was weighing in on turning <code>appendonly on</code> and using <code>appendfsync everysec</code>. For anyone who has had experience of both sides of the coin:</p>

<p>1) Will using <code>appendonly on</code> and <code>appendfsync everysec</code> cause a performance downgrade? Will it hit the CPU? The write load is on the high side.</p>

<p>2) Once I restart the redis server with these new settings, I'll still lose the last 60 secs of my data, correct? </p>

<p>3) Are restart times something to worry about? My <code>dump.rdb</code> file is small; ~90MB.</p>

<p>I'm trying to find out more about redis persistence, and getting my expectations right. Personally, I'm fine with losing 60s of data in the case of a catastrophe, thus whether I should use AOF is also something I'm pondering. Feel free to chime in. Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>const foo = await new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    request.get(url, (err, res2, data) =&gt; {
        const $ = cheerio.load(data)
        let s = $(""tbody &lt; table.table_lt"").text().replace(/\t/g, '').replace(/\n/g, '')
        resolve(s)
    })  
})

"How do I add a top and bottom shadow while scrolling but only when needed?

<p><strong>How do I add a shadow when a container overflows but only when needed?</strong></p>

<p>What I mean by this is:</p>

<ul>
<li>if there is content available to scroll either on top or bottom, show a shadow to tell the user there is more content to scoll</li>
<li>if there isn't content to scroll through, a shadow will not appear</li>
</ul>

<p>And to clarify further</p>

<ul>
<li>if the content of the container overflows (i.e. it scrolls) and the user is at the very top of the content then there should be a shadow on the <em>bottom</em> of the page and not the top.</li>
<li>Same goes if the user is at the bottom of the page expect that there should be a shadow on the top</li>
<li>if the content does not overflow the container, then <em>no</em> shadow should be shown to keep things clean.</li>

"Express.js Routing error: Can't set headers after they are sent

<p>I'm not really sure why I'm getting this error. It's a simple API built on express.js to be able to add and remove posts. The error occurs when I trigger the delete router. I've read that the error typically happens when there are two callbacks, however, I don't seem to be able find any double callbacks.</p>

<pre><code>    _http_outgoing.js:344

"What is the best way to declare on UI component in android with Kotlin?

<p>I'm trying to build android application using Kotlin for the first time.</p>

<p>I want to declare on some buttons outside the OnCreate method and i can initialize them only Inside this function with findViewById.</p>

<p>Can i declare in simple and clean code like in java?</p>

<pre><code>private Button btnProceed;
</code></pre>

<p>Because when converting it to Kotlin it look like:</p>

<pre><code>private var btnProceed: Button? = null
</code></pre>

<p>And then when initialize OnClick function need to add ! sign:</p>

<pre><code>btnProceed!!.setOnClickListener
</code></pre>

<p>What is the right and cleanest way? </p>

"react-native prop type for text style

<p>i have component with a simple structure and a <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> somewhere inside the tree for which i want to pass in a style. Which works perfectly but for the proptypes validation.</p>

<p>The basic setup is not much more than that</p>

<pre><code>export default class Component extends PureComponent {
    render() {
        return (&lt;View&gt;&lt;Text style={this.props.style}&gt;Some text&lt;/Text&gt;&lt;/view&gt;);

Component.defaultProps = {
    style: null,
};

Component.propTypes = {
    style: ViewPropTypes.style,
};

<p>The problem is that the ViewPropTypes.style does not contain i.e. <code>color</code> key. So providing a style with a color is invalid and produces a warning.

I have to make a Windows Form Application which has to be a cat chasing a mouse. And you love the mouse with the arrow keys while that cat is going towards the mouse. It should detect when the they both get in contact and show the time it took. Both the cat and mouse should be placed randomly in the window each new game.

"Prevent dismissal of modal view controller in SwiftUI

<p>At WWDC 2019, Apple announced a new ""card-style"" look for modal presentations, which brought along with it built-in gestures for dismissing modal view controllers by swiping down on the card. They also introduced the new <code>isModalInPresentation</code> property on <code>UIViewController</code> so that you can disallow this dismissal behavior if you so choose.</p>

<p>So far, though, I have found no way to emulate this behavior in SwiftUI. Using the <code>.presentation(_ modal: Modal?)</code>, does not, as far as I can tell, allow you to disable the dismissal gestures in the same way. I also attempted putting the modal view controller inside a <code>UIViewControllerRepresentable</code> <code>View</code>, but that didn't seem to help either:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyViewControllerView: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    func makeUIViewController(context: UIViewControllerRepresentableContext&lt;MyViewControllerView&gt;) -&gt; UIHostingController&lt;MyView&gt; {
        return UIHostingController(rootView: MyView())
    }

    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: UIHostingController&lt;MyView&gt;, context: UIViewControllerRepresentableContext&lt;MyViewControllerView&gt;) {
        uiViewController.isModalInPresentation = true
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even after presenting with <code>.presentation(Modal(MyViewControllerView()))</code> I was able to swipe down to dismiss the view. Is there currently any way to do this with existing SwiftUI constructs?</p>

"Qt: Program is crashing when deleting central widget of QMainWindow in destructor

<p>I am learning Qt. Currently I stuck at layout stuff for <code>QMainWindow</code>. As suggested in some of examples available on internet i used <code>QWidget</code> to be used in <code>setCentralWidget(QWidget*)</code> method of QMainWindow. But as part of clean up when i am deleting central <code>QWidget</code> the program is crashing.</p>

<p>here is the code for .h</p>

<pre><code>class MyMainWindow : public QMainWindow

    ~MyMainWindow();

    QWidget* m_central_widget;
    QPushButton* m_increase_pressure;
    QPushButton* m_decrease_pressure;
};

<p>for .cpp</p>

<pre><code>MyMainWindow::MyMainWindow(QWidget *parent)
    : QMainWindow(parent)
    , m_central_widget(new QWidget(this))
    , m_increase_pressure(new QPushButton(""+"", this))

MyMainWindow::~MyMainWindow()
{
    delete m_central_widget; // commenting this line doesn't  crash the program

"Why is the greatest IEEE floating point representable number smaller than 1.0 equals to half a machine epsilon?

We can represent 1.0 as 2^0 x 1.0 and the greatest representable number smaller than 1.0 as k, where k = 2^0 x 0.111.......1 truncated to fit.

Then the difference or ulp for 1.0 - k = 2^0 x 0.00000.....1.

isn't that the same as machine epsilon, where we have 

epsilon = 2^0 x 1.000000....1 - 2^0 x 1.000 = 2^0 x 0.000.....1?

"how to calculate average lenght of time in a list

I have a csv file with two columns: date and price. 
I am trying to figure out how long, on average the price stays within a certain range. Let say my values are [10, 7.7, 9.5, 15, 8.8, 9.3, 7.7, 16] For example when the value is between 8 - 9.9, how long on average before it is >14 (not going backwards). 9.5 passes 14 in 1 day. 8.8 in 3 days. 9.3 in 2 days. 7.7 in 1 day. So the average is (1 + 3 + 2 + 1 )/4 = 1.75 days.
I am trying to create a program that does that calculation for me but I am having problems.

first the  pseudocode: 

create new function

iterate over the rows (for i in rows:)

check for the presence of median price range where I want the check to start (if 8 < x < 9.9), store x as initial value variable y

time to reset and increment the index, for next row increment index i

when x leaves bound (if  x > 14) store index i in dictionary z (not sure this step makes sense)

after all rows are iterated through, average all indexes stored in z

code:


from itertools import*

list = [10, 7.7, 9.5, 15, 8.8, 9.3, 7.7, 16] (in reality this will be a csv file with rows)

def new_function()

	for i in list:

	while 8 < x < 9.99: 
	
	elif x > 14 (store index in z?)

"Using classes vs constructor functions in TypeScript

I am starting to write my first little app in TypeScript. Before, I did a lot of reading on the JavaScript classes and how *bad* and *fake* they are in JavaScript. That's why I decided to use good old constructor functions in my TS application, but after I wrote my first interface, a problem arose - how do I implement it in my constructor function?

Let's say I have an interface:
```
interface WebScraper {
  url: string,
  getRawContent(): string,
}
```

when I used classes I would simply code

```
class Scraper implements WebScraper {
  //...
}
```

but how do I do it for a constructor function? I will be using it with the `new` keyword so it will return an object with specific properties. Would that be correct then, if I specify the interface as the return type?

```
function Scraper(): WebScraper {
  //...
}
```

I actually tried that and got an error
```
error TS2355: A function whose declared type is neither 'void' nor 'any' must return a value.

How do I solve this then?",LQ

"webpack loaders and include

<p>I'm new to webpack and I'm trying to understand loaders as well as its properties such as test, loader, include etc.</p>

<p>Here is a sample snippet of webpack.config.js that I found in google.</p>

<pre><code>module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        include: [
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'index.js'),
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'config.js'),
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'lib'),
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'app'),
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'src')
        ],
        exclude: [
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'test', 'test.build.js')
        ],
        cacheDirectory: true,
        query: {
          presets: ['es2015']
        }
      },
    ]
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Am I right that test: /.js$/ will be used only for files with extension .js?</p></li>
<li><p>The loader: 'babel-loader', is the loader we install using npm</p></li>
<li><p>The include: I have many questions on this. Am I right that anything we put inside the array will be transpiled? That means, index.js, config.js, and all *.js files in lib, app and src will be transpiled.</p></li>
<li><p>More questions on the include: When files get transpiled, do the *.js files get concatenated into one big file?</p></li>
<li><p>I think exclude is self explanatory. It will not get transpiled.</p></li>

"Getting address of class member function and calling it from pointer

"Java multiple replace on a single pass

<p>I'm trying to translate nodes on a newick formatted tree, and I'm having trouble getting the replacing right. Say I have the <code>HashMap</code>:</p>

"",1:"" : "",30:"" 
""(30:"" : ""(6:""
"",30:"" : "",6:""

<p>And the tree:</p>

<pre><code>(30:0.07,(1:0.06,2:0.76))

<p>Conventional wisdom would suggest multiple <code>replaceAll</code>, but this poses a problem: </p>

replaceAll(""(30:"", ""(6:"") &gt;&gt; (6:0.07,(6:0.06,2:0.76))

<p>The problem here is we've replaced a node that was previously replaced. The correct tree should look like:</p>

<pre><code>(6:0.07,(30:0.06,2:0.76))

"Can I use Amazon AWS Lambda as a secure enclave for trusted computing?

<p>I would like to use AWS Lambda to perform a computation on behalf of a 3rd party and then prove to them that I did so as intended. A proof would be a cryptographically signed digest of the function body, the request, and the response. Ideally, Amazon would sign the digest with its own private key and publish their public key to allow verification of the signature. The idea is similar to the ""secure enclave"" that new Intel chips provide through SGX (Software Guard Extensions).</p>

<p>The existing Lambda service has some of the ingredients needed. For example, the GetFunction response includes a CodeSha256 field that uniquely identifies the function implementation. And the Amazon API Gateway allows you to make HTTPS requests to the Lambda service, which might allow a TLSNotary-style proof of the request-response contents. But to do this right I think AWS Lambda needs to provide the signature directly.</p>

"PHP - How to fix undefined index error elegantly?

This is probably a generic question and 99% of the solutions I've read is to just use `isset` to be safe and verbose. However, I still think it's not that elegant and also a bit repetitive.

To understand my question a bit better, here's a general pattern on my code:

    class User {
      protected $name;
      protected $address;
    
      public function __construct() {
        ..
      }
    
      public function getName() {
        ..
      }
    
      public function setName() {
        ..
      }
    
      public function getAddress() {
        ..
      }
    
      public function setAddress() {
        ..
      }
    
      public static function buildObject(array $userProperties) {
        // Here, I'm building a user from an associative array.
        // If the developer passes in an array with missing name or address,
        // this will generate an undefined index error!
    
        $user = new User();
        $user->setName($userProperties['name']);
        $user->setAddress($userProperties['address']);
        return $user;
      }
    }

What I've tried so far:

 1. Adding in `isset()` checks on all set calls. This might not be a bad idea for this example, but I have some huge classes with a lot of properties and it looks and feels very repetitive.

 2. Making the array safe by looping over properties and setting them to null if they're not present in the array. This doesn't seem that bad in code but feels like a workaround.

 3. Using null coalesce operator `?? null`. This also feels repetitive and not that readable.

I'd prefer a simple solution that would not add much logic but will look elegant. I know it's preferable to have validation in here, but I'll encounter the same problem when handling optional fields.",LQ

"Compiling Code on Linux Server Seems to Run Differently

<p>I couldn't think of a good way to name this question, as the description of the issue is pretty lengthy.  Basically, the issue I'm having is, code that I wrote in Xcode on my mac isn't running the same after I upload to a linux server for my school.  I've never had this issue before.  Its not a syntax issue, which is something that I might run into (IE maybe I dont need to include a certain header file on Xcode that needs to be included to run on the linux server, so I get an error when I try to compile there), but its a logic error.  One specific if-else statement is evaluating entirely wrong.  It works correctly in Xcode, but with the same .cc file uploaded to the linux server and compiled with a makefile, it has a totally different result, using the same exact input that was used in Xcode.  I even open the .cc file with emacs after uploading to make sure none of the code has been altered from a botched upload, but nothing has changed at all.  This is very strange.  I've never ran into this sort of issue before.  I'd like to provide the code, but it might be entirely too long, so I need to break it down into a smaller example.  For now, I'd like to know if this is something anyone else has ever ran into.  The assignment deals with graph theory.  I'm typing in 'A' and 'B' to draw edges between two vertices.  You can see it works from the Xcode build, but not from the Linux build.</p>

"Android Support Library 23.2 vector drawables are blurry

<p>The latest version of the Android Support Library (23.2) adds support for vector drawables. It appears to do this by rasterizing the vectors on the fly on platforms that don't natively support vector drawables.</p>

<p>However, the rasterize image seems to be a fixed size rather that dependent on usage. Here's an example.</p>

<p><strong>Vector</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;vector xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        android:width=""24dp""
        android:height=""24dp""
        android:viewportWidth=""24.0""
        android:viewportHeight=""24.0""&gt;
    &lt;path
        android:fillColor=""#FF000000""
        android:pathData=""M12,2C6.48,2 2,6.48 2,12s4.48,10 10,10 10,-4.48 10,-10S17.52,2 12,2zm0,3c1.66,0 3,1.34 3,3s-1.34,3 -3,3 -3,-1.34 -3,-3 1.34,-3 3,-3zm0,14.2c-2.5,0 -4.71,-1.28 -6,-3.22 0.03,-1.99 4,-3.08 6,-3.08 1.99,0 5.97,1.09 6,3.08 -1.29,1.94 -3.5,3.22 -6,3.22z""/&gt;
&lt;/vector&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Layout</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ImageView
  android:layout_width=""128dp""
  android:layout_height=""128dp""
  android:id=""@+id/imageView""
  app:srcCompat=""@drawable/vector1""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The vector is 24dp x 24dp. It's used in an ImageView that's 128dp x 128dp. On platforms that's don't support vector drawables, the resulting image is blurry because the vector is rasterized at 16dp and resized to 128dp.</p>

<p>The only solution I've found is to create a separate vector drawable for each intended size. It's pretty annoying to create a bunch of duplicate vectors with only the height and width changes. And that doesn't solve the problem if you want the drawable to fill_parent or be dynamically sized in some other way.</p>

<p>Having to define the dimensions of your vector images in advanced <em>almost</em> completely defeats the benefit of using vectors in the first place.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a true work around?</p>

"How to decompress LUA script from Android .apk assets folder?

<p>I am trying to reverse engineer an Android game to find out the logic behind their calculation.</p>

<p>After extraction of .apk file, there are lua script in /assets/lua folder and all of them have .lua extension. However if open with Text/HEX editor, they are not human readable.</p>

<p>For example: <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/ryan_nguyen/public-files/raw/9073c75365c20865a72ec528d89a0b1643caa57d/taskdata.lua"" rel=""noreferrer"">this file</a> </p>

<p>The content of all files end with ""droi.lua"" signature, made me think this is not a LUA script but some sort of compressed LUA script for Android. And Android has a mechanism to compress file for publishing purpose.</p>

<p>Has anyone experienced this before? Is there a way to make such file readable?</p>

<p>Is there any method / program to decompress files extraced from .apk assets (such as png, lua etc)?</p>

I have a friend who live in HOSTEL, his roommates aren’t very trustworthy people, he said to me, to make something for him, so that He could know which files and folders were opened in his absence by his roommates? _(They have a mutual agreement of not opening someone personal folders)_ _(He is supposed to share PC and can’t hide or encrypt his personal folders)_

So I decided to go with C# because my friend is using Windows OS.

So The task is to make a Windows Form Application that will logs name and location of every file and folder opened by user _(in file or DB doesn’t matter)_ during the application running time.

"Decoder's weights of Autoencoder with tied weights in Keras

<p>I have implemented a tied weights Auto-encoder in Keras and have successfully trained it. </p>

<p>My goal is to use only the decoder part of the Auto-encoder as the last layer of another network, to fine tune both the network and the decoder.</p>

<p>Thing is, as you can see below from the summary, the decoder has no parameters with my tied weights implementation, so there is nothing to be fine tuned. (<code>decoder.get_weights()</code> returns <code>[]</code>)</p>

<p>My question is: Should I change the implementation of the tied weights, so that the tied layer can still hold weights, that is the transposed weights of the encoder? If yes, how? </p>

<p>Or am I just way off?</p>

<p>Below is the summary of the autoencoder model as well as the class of the tied Dense layer (slightly modified from <a href=""https://github.com/nanopony/keras-convautoencoder/blob/master/autoencoder_layers.py"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/nanopony/keras-convautoencoder/blob/master/autoencoder_layers.py.</a>)</p>

"Validation Using MVVM Light in a Universal Windows App

The only trick is that the Textbox is part of a UserControl (cleaned up unnecessary xaml code for clarity) since it will be used multiple times. Also I added DataAnnotations and ValidationResult  for demonstration and not to suggest that this is the best way to do it or that it is working in any way so far.</p>

"Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'bundle.js' in '/Users/jonathankuhl/Documents/Programming/node js/sandbox/webpack-app'

<p>I am trying to go through a very basic tutorial about Webpack.  I cannot get it to compile a very basic single line javascript application.  I have installed and uninstalled it multiple times.</p>

<p>It's just a tutorial to learn how to use Webpack.  I used <code>npm init</code> to set up the <code>package.json</code> and did nothing else to touch that file.  I have a single index.html file and a single app.js file that is suppose to bundle into a bundle.js file.</p>

<p>I enter: <code>webpack app.js bundle.js</code> into the terminal</p>

<p>I keep getting this error:</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?  I'm literally doing exactly what the tutorial is telling me to do, step by step.  I don't know much about webpack, thought I should look into it, since I want a job in web development.  I don't know what it means by ""can't resolve 'bundle.js'.  It's as if bundle.js doesn't exist, but it's not supposed to exist, webpack creates it.</p>

<p>I've tried alternatives such as doing <code>npm run build</code> after adding <code>""build"":""webpack""</code> to my package.json under <code>""scripts""</code>, and had no luck.  That was before I deleted the entire directory and started over.  I've installed and uninstalled both webpack and webpack-cli a few times as well.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>I'm currently trying to make multiple-files inheritance in ES6, with node.JS and Babel (I'm using Babel to convert the code from ES6 to ES5 'cause Node don't implement ES6 right now).
I'm using import/export to ""link"" the differents files.</p>

{
    constructor(x, y, color)
    {
        super(x, y);

import ColorPoint from './colorpointES5'

var m_point = new Point();
var m_colorpoint = new ColorPoint();

console.log(m_point.toString());
console.log(m_colorpoint.toString());

<p>I'm doin' that to test the toString() methods calls, from Parent and from Child.<br>
So then I use Babel to convert the code from ES6 to ES5 and I run each parts separately to test if it's ok or not.<br>
- Point (the Parent) is good, and execute without error.<br>
- ColorPoint (the Child) don't run completely and throw :  </p>

"How do I add a second die to this elm effects example?

<p>I am new to Elm and have been looking at the following example (note this is under the newer 0.17 architecture, where Action is now Command):
<a href=""http://elm-lang.org/examples/random"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://elm-lang.org/examples/random</a></p>

<p>There is a follow up challenge to add a second die to the example, so that a single click of the button rolls a new value for each die.  My idea is to change the model to hold two separate values, one for each die, ala</p>

<pre><code>type alias Model =
       { dieFace1 : Int
       , dieFace2 : Int
       }

<p>This works fine until I get to the update block.  I am not sure how to update the Random number generator to create two values.  The function is a bit confusing to me.</p>

  = Roll
  | NewFace Int Int


update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Roll -&gt;
      **(model, Random.generate NewFace (Random.int 1 6))** &lt;-- not sure what to do here

    NewFace newFace1 newFace2 -&gt;
      (Model newFace1 newFace2, Cmd.none)

"Find all the numbers in one file that are not in another file in python

<p>There are two files, say FileA and FileB and we need to find all the numbers that are in FileA which is not there in FileB. All the numbers in the FileA are sorted and all the numbers in FileB are sorted. For example,</p>

<p>Input:</p>

FileB = [1, 3, 4, 6, ...]

<p>The memory is very limited and even one entire file cannot be loaded into memory at a time. Also linear or lesser time complexity is needed. </p>

<p>So if the files are small enough to fit in the memory, we could load them and initialize its contents as two sets and then take a set difference so that the problem is solved in O(1) or constant time complexity.</p>

<pre><code>set(contentsofFileA)-set(contentsofFileB)
</code></pre>

<p>But since the files are so big, they won't be able to load entirely into the memory and so this is not possible.</p>

<p>Also, another approach would be to use a brute force method with batch processing. So, we load a chunk or batch of data from FileA and then a batch from FileB and then compare it and then the next chunk from FileB and so on. Then after the FileA chunk is checked over all the elements in FileB then load the next batch from FileA and this continues. But this would create an O(n^2) or quadratic time complexity and not efficient for a very large file with large entries.</p>

<p>The problem is required to be solved in linear or lesser time complexity and without loading the entire files into memory. Any help?</p>

"[C#][Windows Forms] How to stop passing value from one form to other in formclosing event?

So, I got 2 forms (form1,form2),**form1** is the main form. I got one textbox and one radiobutton and a simple button in form2, and 1 onlyreadable-textbox with label on the side, and simple button in **form1**. The form1 button opens the form2 window. In form2, I can write numbers in textbox, and then select the valute on radio button(Euro) and when I click on the passvalue button the numbers and valute are passed to the form 1 textbox(numbers) and label(valute). That works fine, but when I open the form2 window and don't write anything in textbox, also don't check the radiobutt, and click on the red X for closing the form 2, the form will close and the values in form 1(where there was added values before) disappears. For example: I add a value of 2000 euros to form 1 textbox&label, and then when I open one more time the form2, and leave the texbox clear and radiobutt unchecked, close the form2 with the X, the form1 values of 2000 euros will disappear.

"Why can companies charge money for their JDK Version despite the GNU GPL v2 of OpenJDK?

<p>OpenJDK is released under the GNU General Public License v2.0 with a classpath exception. If you modify software under such license, you are obliged to release it under the GPL as well. 
So how come e.g. IBM can charge you for their modified version of the OpenJDK, which mostly includes bugfixes and minor optimizations by changing the existing OpenJDK (which means this doesn't fall under the classpath exception)? Don't they have to release it under the GPL as well which would make it free to use?</p>

"Applying MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining to F# functions

<p>The attribute <code>System.Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodImplAttribute</code> can be used to give hints to the JIT compiler about how to handle the decorated method. In particular, the option <code>MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining</code> instructs the compiler to inline the affected method if possible. Unfortunately the F# compiler seems to simply ignore this attribute when generating IL.</p>

<p>Example: The following C# code</p>

<pre><code>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
public static int Inc(int x) =&gt; x + 1;
</code></pre>

<p>is translated to</p>

<pre><code>.method public hidebysig static int32  Inc(int32 x) cil managed aggressiveinlining
{     
    .maxstack  8
    IL_0000:  ldarg.0
    IL_0001:  ldc.i4.1
    IL_0002:  add
    IL_0003:  ret
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note the ""aggressiveinlining"" flag.</p>

<p>This F# code however</p>

<pre><code>[&lt;MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)&gt;]
let inc x = x + 1
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>.method public static int32  inc(int32 x) cil managed
{
    .maxstack  8
    IL_0000:  nop
    IL_0001:  ldarg.0
    IL_0002:  ldc.i4.1
    IL_0003:  add
    IL_0004:  ret
}
</code></pre>

<p>No ""aggressiveinlining"". I also tried to apply the attribute to static and non-static methods of proper classes (<code>type ...</code>), but the result is the same.</p>

<p>If however I apply it to a custom indexer, like so</p>

<pre><code>type Dummy =
    member self.Item
        with [&lt;MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)&gt;] get x = x + 1
</code></pre>

<p>the resulting IL is</p>

<pre><code>.method public hidebysig specialname instance int32 get_Item(int32 x) cil managed
{
    .custom instance void [mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodImplAttribute::.ctor(valuetype [mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodImplOptions) = ( 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 )

<p>... though I'm not sure whether that is equivalent to the ""aggressiveinling"" flag generated by the C# compiler.</p>

<p>Is that behavior desired/expected? Is it a bug in the F# compiler?</p>

"Integer becomes string in Python

<p>I am learning Python and it is my first programming language. So I tried making a number guessing game where the goal is to guess a number that is within 1 and 100. Every time the player inputs a guess, the program will update the range of possibility. Example: the answer is 50, the player guess 40, then the program would prompt the player to guess a number between 40 and 100... until the player gets the number. Here is my working code:</p>

<pre><code>ans=input('Please enter a number between 1 and 100: ')
guess=input('Please enter your guess: ')
low=1
upp=100
while guess!=ans:
 if ans&gt;guess:
  low=int(guess)
 elif ans&lt;guess:
  upp=int(guess)
 guess=input('The answer is between %d and ' %low + '%d' %upp)
else:
 print('You have guessed correctly!')

<p>This code works as intended, however within the While loop for the assignments of variable 'low' and 'upp', the program would not work if I put 'upp=guess' instead. A TypeError would occur, and it seems like 'upp' (or 'low') has become a string instead of a number.</p>

<li>If I wanted to build a chat app like the tutorial but implement chat <strong>rooms</strong>. Would there be a way for clients to only ""subscribe"" to certain chat rooms only, and avoid transferring the content of every other chat room? How does that affect persistence, if not all data is sync'd to all clients? Do we need to run a special client (ie a server?) that will make sure all data is kept alive at all times?</li>
<li>For that same chat room tutorial, if I want to subscribe to multiple chat rooms, would I need to instantiate multiple Gun instances, with each one using ""peer"" storage?</li>
<li>How should user management/passwords/etc be dealt with in gunDB?
Sending every client a copy of the user DB is interesting from a
replication stand point, but from a security aspect, it seems counter
intuitive.</li>
<li>Is there a way to ask gun to only sync under certain circumstances such as when a WiFi connection is available (think Cordova)?</li>
<li>What about data that's temporal? Is there a way in the chat app, for
instance to tell gunDB that I'm only interested in future messages
and ignore anything that was created prior to a certain
state/timestamp (again to avoid transferring huge amounts of data on
an expensive data plan)?</li>
<li>How do you persist to disk (potentially circular) data in a gunDB and
load the data back in the DB should the need arise?</li>
<li>Can you ask gun to monitor two keys simultaneously? For example if a client needs to display chat data and todo list (both 'keys' from the tutorial) assuming both are 'peered'.</li>
<li>Is there a tutorial for how to use my own server for storage?</li>

"Creating date sequence between two given dates - fails on febuary

Im using the following method to create a date sequence between two given dates;

        public List<DateTime> dateSeq(DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate)

            List<DateTime> allDates = new List<DateTime>();

            allDates.Add(date);

            return allDates;
        }


Creating a date sequence while incrementing 1 month, when the given date for example are: 

startDate: 2017-01-01 
endDate: 2017-05-01 

the sequence i get is fine:

2017-01-01
2017-02-01
2017-03-01
2017-04-01
2017-05-01

But when the given dates are:

startDate: 2017-01-31 
endDate: 2017-05-31

The sequence i get fail when passing febuary setting the rest of the months sequence on the 28th day:

2017-01-31
2017-02-28
2017-03-28
2017-04-28
2017-05-28


Can someone please explain why is that?

I would like to make an android layout with 5 input fields and a button.
The distance between the 5 fields must be zero and that there is the same distance between the button, the 5 fields and the edges.

If I use vertical chains for distances, I also move the fields. Is there a way to create a block with the 5 fields so that the vertical chain command does not move them ??
Do you have other solutions ??

"Matplotlib set_color_cycle versus set_prop_cycle

<p>One of my favorite things to do in Matplotlib is to set the color-cycle to match some colormap, in order to produce line-plots that have a nice progression of colors across the lines. Like this one:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vaoiJ.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vaoiJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Previously, this was one line of code using <code>set_color_cycle</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ax.set_color_cycle([plt.cm.spectral(i) for i in np.linspace(0, 1, num_lines)])
</code></pre>

<p>But, recently I see a warning:</p>

<pre><code>MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: 
The set_color_cycle attribute was deprecated in version 1.5. 
Use set_prop_cycle instead.
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>set_prop_cycle</code>, I can achieve the same result, but I need to <code>import cycler</code>, and the syntax is less compact:</p>

<pre><code>from cycler import cycler
colors = [plt.cm.spectral(i) for i in np.linspace(0, 1, num_lines)]
ax.set_prop_cycle(cycler('color', colors))
</code></pre>

<p>So, my questions are: </p>

<p>Am I using <code>set_prop_cycle</code> correctly? (and in the most efficient way?)</p>

<p>Is there an easier way to set the color-cycle to a colormap? In other words, is there some mythical function like this? </p>

<pre><code>ax.set_colorcycle_to_colormap('jet', nlines=30)
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code for the complete example:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ax = plt.subplot(111)
num_lines = 30

colors = [plt.cm.spectral(i) for i in np.linspace(0, 1, num_lines)]

# old way: 
ax.set_color_cycle(colors)

# new way:
from cycler import cycler
ax.set_prop_cycle(cycler('color', colors))

for n in range(num_lines):
    x = np.linspace(0,10,500)
    y = np.sin(x)+n
    ax.plot(x, y, lw=3)

"Jest beforeAll() share between multiple test files

<p>I have a Node.js project that I'm testing using Jest.  I have several test files that have the same setup requirement.  Previously, all these tests were in one file, so I just had a <code>beforeAll(...)</code> that performed the common setup.  Now, with the tests split into multiple files, it seems like I have to copy/paste that <code>beforeAll(...)</code> code into each of the files.  That seems inelegant - is there a better way to do this, ideally where I can just write my <code>beforeAll(...)</code>/setup logic once, and ""require"" it from multiple test files?  Note that there are other tests in my test suite that don't require this setup functionality, so I don't want to make <em>all</em> my tests run this setup (just a particular subset of test files).</p>

If I add `--copy-dirlinks` and `--keep-dirlinks` options:

    rsync -rkK --delete /home/inkjet/prds /home/inkjet/fnts rsync
    ://192.168.4.94:12000/files
    rsync: delete_file: unlink(fnts) failed: Permission denied (13)
    could not make way for new directory: fnts
    
What options are needed to get the files in `/home/inkjet/fnts (/usr/local/inkjet/fnts)` and `/home/inkjet/bmps` synced on both machines (without creating separate modules and running rsync for each)?

"Making copies of large lists to trigger change detection for pure pipes in Angular 2 affecting performance

<p>I have an array <code>a</code> containing 50,000+ objects and I have a pipe which takes this array <code>a</code> and transforms this into some output which is then displayed in the view.</p>

<p>The pipe is pure meaning that only when the reference to array <code>a</code> changes will it re-evaluate.</p>

<p>I have a method <code>modifyArray</code> which adds/removes some elements from array <code>a</code>. When completed I would like the pipe to be re-evaluated so that the view re-renders.</p>

<p>Because of the way that Angular enforces immutability, the only option I have for the pipe to be re-evaluated is for the method <code>modifyArray</code> to return a copy of array <code>a</code> with the changes applied, so that Angular can detect that the reference has changed and trigger the pipe, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>modifyArray(a: T[]): T[] {

  a.push(b);
  a.slice(c);

  return [...a];
}
</code></pre>

<p>However for such an array with 50,000+ elements, there is a real performance degradation when making a copy of the array.</p>

<p>I would have expected that explicitly triggering change detection after invocation of this method, for example by calling <code>ApplicationRef.tick()</code> or <code>ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()</code>, would allow Angular to figure out that the array has been modified, but this is not the case:</p>

<pre><code>this.a = modifyArray(a);

this.applicationRef.tick();
</code></pre>

<p>Making a copy of the array is not an option as the data set is too large. Making the pipe not pure is also not an option as the transformation the pipe applies to the input is expensive.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas on how this can be achieved?</p>

"How to handle changing parquet schema in Apache Spark

<p>I have run into a problem where I have Parquet data as daily chunks in S3 (in the form of <code>s3://bucketName/prefix/YYYY/MM/DD/</code>) but I cannot read the data in AWS EMR Spark from different dates because some column types do not match and I get one of many exceptions, for example:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.ClassCastException: optional binary element (UTF8) is not a group
</code></pre>

<p>appears when in some files there's an array type which has a value but the same column may have <code>null</code> value in other files which are then inferred as String types.</p>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 23 in stage 42.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 23.3 in stage 42.0 (TID 2189, ip-172-31-9-27.eu-west-1.compute.internal):
org.apache.spark.SparkException: Failed to merge incompatible data types ArrayType(StructType(StructField(Id,LongType,true), StructField(Name,StringType,true), StructField(Type,StringType,true)),true)
</code></pre>

<p>I have raw data in S3 in JSON format and my initial plan was to create an automatic job, which starts an EMR cluster, reads in the JSON data for the previous date and simply writes it as parquet back to S3.</p>

<p>The JSON data is also divided into dates, i.e. keys have date prefixes. Reading JSON works fine. Schema is inferred from the data no matter how much data is currently being read.</p>

<p>But the problem rises when parquet files are written. As I understand, when I write parquet with metadata files, these files contain the schema for all parts/partitions of the parquet files. Which, to me it seems, can also be with different schemas. When I disable writing metadata, Spark was said to infer the whole schema from the first file within the given Parquet path and presume it stays the same through other files.</p>

<p>When some columns, which should be <code>double</code> type, have only integer values for a given day, reading in them from JSON (which has these numbers as integers, without floating points) makes Spark think it is a column with type <code>long</code>. Even if I can cast these columns to double before writing the Parquet files, this still is not good as the schema might change, new columns can be added, and tracking this is impossible. </p>

<p>I have seen some people have the same problems but I have yet to find a good enough solution. </p>

<p>What are the best practices or solutions for this? </p>

<p>I'm writing the code for a login. I've gotten the code from another resource. Everything seems to be okay, but it keeps telling me that the Alumni_ID (the username) does not exist- even though it does. </p>

<p>The php code for the login:</p>

"What is the best way to execute form submission?

<p>Please excuse any ignorant or ametuer perspective that I may seem to have.  I am indeed an aspiring web developer :)</p>

<p>The only thing that I need to achieve right now is having the user fill out a form with only two fields and have that information end up in my inbox.</p>

<p>After much searching and different solutions/opinions from a WIDE variety of sources and dev types, I still cannot seem to find a step by step process of how to best implement this seemingly simple issue I'm having. </p>

<p>Now, I'm willing to learn what I may need to, but I have no idea where to start.  I've been told PHP, Django(Python), JavaScript and a whole slew of others.</p>

<p>I can build the form with out an issue.  It's getting that information to my email that I'm stuck on!</p>

<p>Any and all feedback is much appreciated.  Thank you!</p>

"Can someone help me figure out why my mini-max tic-tac-toe AI does not work?

This is me trying to make a minimax tic-tac-toe game. The AI for some reason still goes in order in which the spot turns up on the list for the board. It looks like it is calculating the scores, but I do not think it is utilizing them for some reason. It is supposed to pick the spot with the highest score. It outputs many ""You win"", ""TIE"", and ""You lose"" strings because I wanted to make sure it was iterating through the spaces and combinations. Please help!

"Implement Hashmap with different value types in Kotlin

<p>Is it possible to have a hashmap in Kotlin that takes different value types?</p>

<p>I've tried this:</p>

<pre><code>val template = ""Hello {{world}} - {{count}} - {{tf}}""

val context = HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;()
context.put(""world"", ""John"")
context.put(""count"", 1)
context.put(""tf"", true)
</code></pre>

<p>... but that gives me a type mismatch (apparantly <code>""John""</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>true</code> are not Objects) </p>

<p>In Java you can get around this by creating types <code>new String(""John"")</code>, <code>new Integer(1)</code>, <code>Boolean.TRUE</code>, I've tried the equivalent in Kotlin, but still getting the type mismatch error.</p>

<pre><code>context.put(""tf"", Boolean(true))

<p>Then again, MsBuild also ships with an msbuild.exe - which, correct me if I'm wrong, is able to actually compile projects. But how would this tie in with Roslyn, assuming msbuild.exe can compile projects, but so can Roslyn?</p>

<p>Does msbuild.exe use Roslyn to compile, in case of MSBuild 15? Are they completely seperate? Am I misunderstanding anything?</p>

<p>And furthermore &amp; more specifally: Assuming I want programatically create simple .csproj files, and use Roslyn's MSBuildWorkspace to handle/populate and finally compile these.
Would the end user of my application need to have Microsoft's build tools installed on their machine? Or is this not necessary, as Roslyn would be able to read &amp; compile these independently of any local MSBuild installation?</p>

"how to access history object in new React Router v4

<p>I have tried all the suggested ways in other threads and it is still not working which is why I am posting the question.</p>

<p>So I have <code>history.js</code> looking like this</p>

<pre><code>import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

export default createBrowserHistory;
</code></pre>

<p>My <code>index.js</code></p>

<pre><code>render((
        &lt;Router history={history}&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;Route component={App}/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/Router&gt;
    ), document.getElementById('root')
);
</code></pre>

<p><code>Home.js</code> Looks like this</p>

<pre><code>class Home extends Component {
    handleSubmit(e) {
        e.preventDefault();

        let teacherName = e.target.elements[0].value;
        let teacherTopic = e.target.elements[1].value;
        let path = `/featured/${teacherName}/${teacherTopic}`;
        history.push(path);

    }

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div className=""main-content home""&gt;
                &lt;hr /&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;Featured Teachers&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}&gt;
                    &lt;input type=""text"" placeholder=""Name""/&gt;
                    &lt;input type=""text"" placeholder=""Topic""/&gt;
                    &lt;button type=""submit""&gt; Submit &lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}

export default Home;
</code></pre>

<p>Home.js is actually routed in app.js which is routed in index.js.</p>

<p>The problem is that I cannot access history object anywhere.</p>

<p>The ways I have tried are as below</p>

<p>1) <code>this.context.history.push(path)</code> in home.js - cannot access context of undefined</p>

<p>2) <code>this.props.history.push(path)</code> in home.js - cannot access props of undefined</p>

<p>3) <code>browserHistory.push(path)</code> in index.js - this is deprecated now</p>

<p>4) the way above - _history2.default.push is not a function</p>

<p>None of the methods that I have tried above works. The second was the strangest as I should be able to access history object as props anywhere according to the documentation <a href=""https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/Route-render-methods"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/Route-render-methods</a></p>

<p>I know the previous v2 or v3 way of accessing history is also deprecated.</p>

<p>So can someone who knows how to access history object in React Router v4 answer this question? Thanks.</p>

"ReportLab: working with Chinese/Unicode characters

<p>TL;DR: 
<b>Is there some way of telling ReportLab to use a specific font, and fallback to another if glyphs for some characters are missing?</b> Alternatively, <b>Do you know of a condensed TrueType font which contains the glyphs for all European languages, Hebrew, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic?</b></p>

<p>I've been creating reports with ReportLab, and have encountered problems with rendering strings containing Chinese characters. The font I've been using is DejaVu Sans Condensed, which does not contain the glyphs for Chinese (however, it does contain Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic and all sorts of Umlauts for European language support - which makes it pretty versatile, and I need them all from time to time)</p>

<p>Chinese, however, is not supported with the font, and I've not been able to find a TrueType font which supports ALL languages, and meets our graphic design requirements. As a temporary workaround, I made it so that reports for Chinese customers use an entirely different font, containing only English and Chinese glyphs, hoping that characters in other languages won't be present in the strings. However this is, for obvious reasons, clunky and breaks the graphic design, since it's not DejaVu Sans, around which the whole look&amp;feel has been designed.</p>

<p><b>So the question is</b>, how would you deal with the need to support multiple languages in one document, and maintain usage of a specified font for each language. This is made more complicated due to the fact that sometimes strings contain a mix of languages, so determining which ONE font should be used for each string is not an option.</p>

<p>Is there some way of telling ReportLab to use a specific font, and fallback to another if glyphs for some characters are missing? I found vague hints in the docs that it should be possible, although I might understand it incorrectly.</p>

<p>Alternatively, Do you know of a condensed TrueType font which contains the glyphs for all European languages, Hebrew, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic?</p>

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Generate a report in multiple formats (if requested) of monitors that are connected to computers.
    .DESCRIPTION
    This script will take a list of computers (from a txt file or from AD) and will
    query each computer through WMI, asking what the serial number and manufacturer is. 
    It can then generate multiple types of reports, CSV, HTML, or e-mail the HTML as the body of the message.
    .PARAMETER CSVReport
    Switch, used to define wether you want a CSV report generated or not.
    .PARAMETER CSVOutputFile
    The location where you want the CSV report to be stored, if the CSVReport switch is true.
    .PARAMETER HTMLReport
    Switch, used to define wether you want an HTML report generated or not.
    .PARAMETER HTMLOutputFile
    The location where you want the HTML report to be stored, if the HTMLReport switch is true.
    .PARAMETER EmailReportAsHTML
    Switch, used to indicate weather you want to send the report via e-mail with the body formatted as HTML.
    .PARAMTER LinkToComputer
    Switch, this is a work in progress (I am figuring out the API's to call to make this work), essentially it
    will be used in conjunction with the ImportToSpiceworks switch and it will define wether you want to link
    the monitors found, to the computers that they were found to be connected to.
    .PARAMETER FromAD
    Switch, used to define wether you want to use AD to define the array or computers to scan if monitors are
    connected to them or not.
    .PARAMTER FromFile
    Switch, used to define wether you want to use a txt file to define the array list of computers to be
    scanned if there is a monitor connected or not.
    .PARAMETER FromFileLocation
    The location where the txt file is located that has the list of computers to be scanned for monitors attached.
    This file should have 1 computer name of each new row.
    .PARAMETER Test
    Switch, this switch is used to test the functionality of the script, against the localhost only.

    .SYNOPSIS
    Simple function to alternate the row colors in an HTML table
    .DESCRIPTION
    This function accepts pipeline input from ConvertTo-HTML or any
    string with HTML in it. It will then search for <tr> and replace 
    it with <tr class=(something)>. With the combination of CSS it
    can set alternating colors on table rows.
    
    CSS requirements:
    .odd { background-color:#ffffff; }
    .even { background-color:#dddddd; }
    
    Classnames can be anything and are configurable when executing the
    function. Colors can, of course, be set to your preference.
    
    This function does not add CSS to your report, so you must provide
    the style sheet, typically part of the ConvertTo-HTML cmdlet using
    the -Head parameter.
    .PARAMETER Line
    String containing the HTML line, typically piped in through the
    pipeline.
    .PARAMETER CSSEvenClass
    Define which CSS class is your ""even"" row and color.
    .PARAMETER CSSOddClass
    Define which CSS class is your ""odd"" row and color.
    .EXAMPLE $Report | ConvertTo-HTML -Head $Header | Set-AlternateRows -CSSEvenClass even -CSSOddClass odd | Out-File HTMLReport.html
    
    $Header can be defined with a here-string as:
    $Header = @""
    <style>
    TABLE {border-width: 1px;border-style: solid;border-color: black;border-collapse: collapse;}
    TH {border-width: 1px;padding: 3px;border-style: solid;border-color: black;background-color: #6495ED;}
    TD {border-width: 1px;padding: 3px;border-style: solid;border-color: black;}
    .odd { background-color:#ffffff; }
    .even { background-color:#dddddd; }
    </style>
    ""@
    
    This will produce a table with alternating white and grey rows. Custom CSS
    is defined in the $Header string and included with the table thanks to the -Head
    parameter in ConvertTo-HTML.

"Parse alternatives for keeping track of usernames and passwords?

<p>I'm creating an app for a local shop and I'm trying to figure out how I can integrate a Username and Password system so people can keep track of their profiles. I've figured out the whole login side of things, but I cant find a server like Parse that would allow me to keep track of all the people who have accounts and what they've chosen on the account. Parse unfortunately is no longer running, and what <strong>is</strong> still running in Parse doesnt give the same feature I require. Right now my login system only works if the user doesnt delete the app, however if it's deleted, the user no longer exists.</p>

"How to create a letter spacing attribute with pycairo?

<p>I'm using Pango + Cairo (through GObject) to render text with python3.7, and would like to set the <em>letter spacing</em> by creating an attribute and attaching that attribute to my pango layout.</p>

<p>In the gnome documentation for pango, I can see that there should be a function called <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/pango-Text-Attributes.html#pango-attr-letter-spacing-new"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>pango_attr_letter_spacing_new</code></a> (since v1.6). However, if I run <code>Pango.attr_letter_spacing_new</code>, I get the error:</p>

<pre><code>AttributeError: 'gi.repository.Pango' object has no attribute 'attr_letter_spacing_new'
</code></pre>

<p>This feels a bit strange, since I can use the <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/pango-Text-Attributes.html#pango-attr-type-get-name"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>pango_attr_type_get_name</code></a> which should only have been available since v1.22.</p>

<p>I have a work-around by using markup with <code>&lt;span letter_spacing=""1234""&gt;</code> but I would rather not go down this route.</p>

<h2>Minimal ""Working"" Example</h2>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code># pip install pycairo==1.18.0 pygobject==3.32.0

import cairo
import gi
gi.require_version('Pango', '1.0')
gi.require_version('PangoCairo', '1.0')
from gi.repository import Pango, PangoCairo

width, height = 328, 48

surface = cairo.ImageSurface(cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, width, height)
context = cairo.Context(surface)
layout = PangoCairo.create_layout(context)

font_desc = Pango.font_description_from_string('Sans, 40px')
layout.set_font_description(font_desc)

# What I can do
layout.set_markup(f'&lt;span letter_spacing=""{1024 * 10}""&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;')

# What I would like to do
if False:
    letter_spacing_attr = Pango.attr_letter_spacing_new(1024 * 10)

    attr_list = Pango.AttrList()
    attr_list.insert(letter_spacing_attr)
    layout.set_attributes(attr_list)

    layout.set_text('Hello World')

PangoCairo.show_layout(context, layout)

with open('help-me.png', 'wb') as image_file:
    surface.write_to_png(image_file)
</code></pre>

<h3>Manually creating a LetterSpacing attribute</h3>

<p>I have been able to find the enum value <code>Pango.AttrType.LETTER_SPACING</code>, which allows me to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>c = Pango.AttrClass()
c.type = Pango.AttrType.LETTER_SPACING
a = Pango.Attribute()
a.init(c)
</code></pre>

<p>However, I haven't been able to find a way to set the value of it, and it makes me think it is the wrong way to approach things :|</p>

<p>Insert this into an <code>Pango.AttrList</code>, gave an error (not surprisingly) and made the python process segfault next time I did something with Pango: </p>

<pre><code>** (process:17183): WARNING **: 12:00:56.985: (gi/pygi-struct-marshal.c:287):pygi_arg_struct_from_py_marshal: runtime check failed: (g_type_is_a (g_type, G_TYPE_VARIANT) || !is_pointer || transfer == GI_TRANSFER_NOTHING)
</code></pre>

<h3>Other leads</h3>

<p>.. that sadly have lead nowhere :(</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/class-pangoattribute.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">pygtk listing a function <code>pango.AttrLetterSpacing</code></a>

<ul>
<li><code>Pango.AttrLetterSpacing</code> => <code>'gi.repository.Pango' object has no attribute 'AttrLetterSpacing'</code></li>
<li><code>Pango.Attrbute.LetterSpacing</code> => <code>type object 'Attribute' has no attribute 'LetterSpacing'</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>the documentation for the pango packge for Vala (which seems to use GObject as well), also shows the <a href=""https://valadoc.org/pango/Pango.attr_letter_spacing_new.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>attr_letter_spacing_new</code> function</a> -- this doesn't really help that much, but suggests that the function should be available through GObject, although I haven't tried.</li>

"Postgres UPDATE with ORDER BY, how to do it?

<p>I need to do a Postgres update on a collection of records &amp; I'm trying to prevent a deadlock which appeared in the stress tests. </p>

<p>The typical resolution to this is to update records in a certain order, by ID for example - but it seems that Postgres doesn't allow ORDER BY for UPDATE.</p>

<p>Assuming I need to do an update, for example:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE BALANCES WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM some_function() ORDER BY ID);
</code></pre>

<p>results in deadlocks when you run 200 queries concurrently. What to do?</p>

"Comparing only dates of DateTimes in Dart

<p>I need to store and compare dates (without times) in my app, without caring about time zones.<br>
I can see three solutions to this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>(date1.year == date2.year &amp;&amp; date1.month == date2.month &amp;&amp; date1.day == date2.day)</code><br>
This is what I'm doing now, but it's horrible verbose.</p></li>
<li><p><code>date1.format(""YYYYMMDD"") == date2.format(""YYYYMMDD"")</code><br>
This is still rather verbose (though not as bad), but just seems inefficient to me...</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new Date class myself, perhaps storing the date as a ""YYYYMMDD"" string, or number of days since Jan 1 1980. But this means re-implementing a whole bunch of complex logic like different month lengths, adding/subtracting and leap years.</p></li>

<p>Creating a new class also avoids an edge case I'm worried about, where adding <code>Duration(days: 1)</code> ends up with the same date due to daylight saving changes. But there are probably edge cases with this method I'm not thinking of...</p>

"Fetch API - using response.json() throws an unexpected end of input error

<p>When using the Fetch API to fetch some JSON from a REST API on my local server and trying to parse the response with <code>response.json()</code>, I am receiving an <code>unexpected end of input</code> error.</p>

//     at SyntaxError (native)
//     at &lt;anonymous&gt;:1:128

<p>Before, my PageKeyedVideosDataSource needed only the page and the per-page to make the call, it was easy. However, now I need to put this new parameter id dynamically inside the PageKeyedDataSource.</p>

<p>I saw <a href=""https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/PagingWithNetworkSample"" rel=""noreferrer"">PagingWithNetworkSample</a> and figured it out that they put a new parameter in PagedKeyedDataSource by adding it in the constructor.

<pre><code>public PageKeyedCategoryVideosDataSource(int categoryId, Repository repository) {
    this.categoryId = categoryId;
    this.repository = repository;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I add the id in the constructor, I think I'll not be able to use dagger 2 anymore because by using dagger 2 the PageKeyedVideosDataSource is not created dynamically, therefore, I can't keep changing the value of the id.</p>

<p>I can create a new conda environment, with program <code>biopython</code> with this:</p>

<pre><code>conda create --name snowflakes biopython
</code></pre>

<p>What if I do not want to install any program? It seems I can not do that:</p>

<pre><code>» conda create --name tryout
Error: too few arguments, must supply command line package specs or --file

You can specify one or more default packages to install when creating
an environment.  Doing so allows you to call conda create without
explicitly providing any package names.

To set the provided packages, call conda config like this:

    conda config --add create_default_packages PACKAGE_NAME

"c# double rounding for xx.5

Is it a good idea to write an extension method  for my application , and specify precision or is there any other good idea or other way to achieve **expected** results?

Due to the behavior of Convert.ToInt32 to truncate , I am doing something like **below** to achieve expected results 

> **Note:** Application requirement is to have percentages as **Integer** and not **decimals** eg 50.50 is 51 and not 50.5


        public decimal TotalScore { get; set; }

        public int TotalCount { get; set; }

        [DataMember(Name = ""currentScore"")]
        public int? CurrentScore
        {
            get
            {
                if (TotalCount > 0)
                {
                    //eg 0.8149863 * 100 = 81.50 ~ 82
                    //Convert.ToInt32 use Math.Truncate , so better to round it first
                    //default MidpointRounding.Toeven SO : 2.5 ~ 2 and 3.5 ~ 4
                    return Convert.ToInt32((Math.Round(Math.Round(TotalScore * 100, 2, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero), MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero)) / TotalCount);


                }
                else
                {
                    return null;
                }
            }
            set
            {
                //Due to the fact WCF will fail with ReadOnly properties.
            }
        }
example:

`'0.8149863 * 100 = 81.50 ~ 82'`
`'0.2021111 * 100 = 20.21 ~ 20'` 
`'0.5889681 * 100 = 58.89 ~ 59'` 

> **Note:** The behavior for Math.Round is as expected when closer to '0' or '10' , but above double rounding is done specially for 'xx.5'(and works for other cases) **Convert.ToInt32** uses truncate and makes no expense in getting accurate results 

I need above behavior quiet a lot , so decided to write an extension as **below** , so to call the extension when calculating percentages on decimal and expecting integer value in return 

        /// <summary>
        /// 
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name=""value""></param>
        /// <param name=""count""></param>
        /// <param name=""decimals"">Number of decimal places </param>
        /// <returns></returns>
        public static int ToIntPercentageWithPrecision(this decimal value , int count , int decimals )
        {
            return Convert.ToInt32((Math.Round(Math.Round(value * 100, decimals, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero), MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero)) / count);
        }

However above solution is not readable and looks confusing . Need a clean and readable solution with accuracy.",LQ
